            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE common Pretence of Dedication, is the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Work, but the true meaning thereof is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Intereſt of the Writer. It is the Practice of the World, to palliate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Gain under the ſhadow of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The acceptance it has met with from Generous Perſons in all Ages, has juſtified this practice. Great Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and reward the Endeavours of the leſſer: Either Honour or Profit, or both, are the Motives that excite moſt
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:108575:7"/>
Men to the deſire of Learning. God himſelf has allotted Rewards to Virtue. The World, in imitation of the Deity, allows a Recompence to all that aſpire to do well. The publiſhing of uſeful Books being in it ſelf a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, the dedicating them to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Honour can not be blameable. When the means uſed for the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Intereſt are lawful and juſt, bare formalities in the execution can not render them diſhonourable. Thus much to ſhew, I pretend not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn an Antient received Cuſtom; but tho' I do not condemn, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve not to follow it in this place. I was ever an Admirer of Naked Truth without Artifice. I have reſolved at this time, Truth ſhall appear bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced. Some may perhaps condemn my Freedom, but Plaindealing is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways commendable.</p>
            <p>I mean Plaindealing, with a due reſpecct to Perſons of Honour: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, it is Rudeneſs, and want of Breeding. I will endeavour, not to incur my own Cenſure. I will freely confeſs my Deſign, but with
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:108575:7"/>
the veneration due to your Birth and Character.</p>
            <p>I ſaid at firſt, that Protection was the Pretence, and Intereſt the Scope of Dedications. I have declared for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Truth, and againſt all Artifice. Then, Sir, not to deviate from my ſelf, I confeſs I propoſe to my ſelf a great Intereſt in this Dedication. This Book in its Native Tongue has recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Approbation of a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. If it has ſuffered in the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, an Honourable Name prefixt, will not, and I cannot expect it ſhould defend it. Then ſince I diſclaim any Defence of the Book, it follows of courſe, I ſeek my own Advantage. The Concluſion is natural, and it is ſo to me to be frank and plain.</p>
            <p>The Advantage I propoſe to my ſelf, is threefold. Firſt, by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, as I do, Favours already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, I gain the Reputation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endued with that rare Virtue, Gratitude. Secondly, by being grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and making ſuch Returns as I am capable of, I hope for an increaſe
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:108575:8"/>
in your Eſteem. And laſtly, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of a Perſon ſo Nobly Born, and bearing ſo great a Character, will be an Honour I ſhall juſtly value my ſelf upon.</p>
            <p>VVhere there is true Nobility, Goodneſs attends it. This makes me confide you will pardon the Freedom and plaineſs of this Epiſtle. Great Men are for the moſt part leſs Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious and Formal, than inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Upſtarts. The Honour of your Character, is viſible to all Men; the Grandeur of your Family, is not leſs apparent in Hiſtory. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Affrican Moores,</hi> and the <hi>Indian</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have been VVitneſſes of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Actions of the <hi>Canha's. Henry</hi> the firſt Earl, and <hi>Alfonſo</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Portugal</hi> were Contemporaries with them for Antiquity. <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> are now the Sphere of their preſent Glories; where are to be ſeen two Dukes, five Marquiſes, and ſeven Earls; beſides ſeveral other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Branches, all ſpringing from the ſame Stock of this your Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Famely.

time, before the Splendor of this Subject draws me on too far. I muſt conſider, your better Employments will not give you Leiſure to Read re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Epiſtles.</p>
            <p>Sir I beg your Attention but to a few words more in Vindication of my ſelf, againſt two Objections that may be made to this Dedication. The firſt is, That you being ſo much a ſtranger, as yet, cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to underſtand the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. The ſecond, That I ſhould preſent the Goverment of a VVife, to one that is not Married. Theſe things that ſeem againſt me, do in reality make for me. For as to the firſt, the Original being in <hi>Portugues</hi> this Tranſlation may be ſome help for learning of <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Objection is as eaſily anſwered, becauſe I could not preſume to preſent a Perſon of your Conduct with Rules to govern a VVife, if you were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed; whereas it is now excuſable, in regard you are not. I fear I have run too far, and will rather there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:108575:9"/>
break off abruptly, then become tedious for the ſake of Method. All I will add ſhall be, to beg Pardon for my ſelf, to wiſh you all increaſe of Honour, and Happineſs, and to deſire you will always be pleaſed to continue your Favour to.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>PHiloſophy</hi> is an univerſal Study, or Conſideration of all Things whereby is attained the knowledge of them. It is divided into two Parts, Natural and Moral. The Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral examins the Qualities of the Heavens, Elements, and Creatures. The Moral diſpoſes the Order of Human Converſation and Life. This is alſo ſubdivided into three Parts; Ethicks, Economy, and Policy. Ethicks, relate to the Manners of Men; Economy treats of the Government of Houſes and Families; Policy appertains
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:108575:10"/>
to the Government of Cities, Kingdoms, and Empires; but in ſuch manner, that Economy has a tincture of Policy, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy is mixed with Economy; becauſe a Kingdom is a great Family, and a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a little Kingdom; and Ethicks require Policy and Economy, becauſe Man is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle World.</p>
            <p>But to ſpeak only of Economy, which is the Subject of this Treatiſe; I ſay this ſort of Philoſophy comprehends all ſorts of People whereof the Commonwealth is made up; the Great, the Middle ſort, and the Small; more particularly, it concerns the Great Ones, becauſe leſs is required towards the preſervation of the other two ſorts. It reaches alſo to all Conditions, the Married, Batchelors, and Widowers, but more particularly the Married, than the Batchelors or Widowers. Not that theſe laſt have not occaſion for Rules to govern their Life by, but becauſe they are States of Life that few adhere to, and that only for a ſhort time; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies are leſs, and therefore have not ſo much to manage, nor do they require that vigilance and care that is requiſite
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:108575:10"/>
in a Married Man, to maintain the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Family, and ſhun Dangers.</p>
            <p>The principal Study of Married Men towards obtaining of Honour, Quiet and Satisfaction, ought to be that which ſhews them how to behave themſelves, and treat their Wives in the due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for upon hitting or miſſing this Point, depends all the good or bad Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Family.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Franciſco,</hi> the Author of this Work, being deſired by a Friend that was about Marrying, to give him ſome good Advice relating to that courſe of Life, writ this Diſcourſe without any Art, but plain and eaſy, as he himſelf owns; this being a good Quality, to gain Credit to what he aſſerts.</p>
            <p>His Deſign was to perſwade Married People to Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, which makes their Lives happy; to recommend the reſpecting and prizing a Wife, to ſhew the means how to preſerve Love, and gain Reputation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xx" facs="tcp:108575:11"/>This Book being yet a Manuſcript, was by ſome People ſlandered, as too ſevere upon the Women; and this was the chief cauſe of making it publick to all; to ſhew how little cauſe there was to paſs that Cenſure upon it; which will appear, by comparing it with others writ upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>Nature teaches, and Experience veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it, That thoſe Medicins which we find moſt difficulty to uſe, are the moſt efficacious. The Rules preſcribed by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians to prevent Sickneſs, are trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, if duly obſerved; yet if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the great Benefit reaped by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they ought to ſeem eaſy. It is plain, the Deſign of Don <hi>Franciſco</hi> was not to raiſe Trouble and Jealouſy, but to ſhew the way to ſhun and prevent them.</p>
            <p>Of all his Works, none perhaps is more uſeful than this, and yet none ſo plain; either becauſe the Subject requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an eaſy Stile, or becauſe he was weary of being reflected upon as obſcure; and therefore reſolved to write for all
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:108575:11"/>
Capacities, ſince he writ for every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but himſelf. Let his Excuſe (if not his Commendation) be, That in all his Writings he endeavoured to ſute his Stile to the Subject; a thing not obſerved by all Men, and attained to but by few. In the Hiſtory of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hiſtorical Elegancy: in his <hi>Political Ecco</hi> he flew higher, becauſe Politicks required it. In his <hi>Great one Little,</hi> and the <hi>Phenix</hi> he writ conciſe and myſtical, that the Morals and Secrets he treated of might be the more grateful for their brevity. In his <hi>Muſes,</hi> lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the beſt Stile, beween the Vulgar and abſtruſe. In his <hi>Pantheon</hi> florid, becauſe Tragedy requires the fineſt of Language, The ſame method be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the other Works, he compoſed before and after theſe here mentioned. The ſame he ſticks to in this, which is the firſt of his <hi>Portugues</hi> Books; and in his <hi>Epanaphoras,</hi> which deſerve much Praiſe for the Elegancy he ſhews in his own Language, as in the others he had proved himſelf Maſter of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</hi>

               <pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:108575:12"/>This Preface I found prefixt to my Author in <hi>Portugues,</hi> and think there is not much to be added to it.</p>
            <p>I confeſs it, leſt it ſhould be ſuſpected I would have it thought my Own, rather than a Tranſlation. Don <hi>Franciſco Manuel</hi> was a Man of good Quality, well Read, and a Traveller, but never Married. If his Rules, or thoſe few Lines I have added, be thought too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere upon the Women, it muſt be by thoſe who either do not Rightly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, or by ſuch as value their Liberty more than their Honour. For there is no Reſtraint preſcribed, but with a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that a Wife be guilty of ſome Extravagancy. And on the other hand, it is often inculcated, that all Reſpect and Liberty is too little for the Woman that is truly virtuous.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not need ſay any thing of Don <hi>Antonio de Guevara,</hi> the Author of the laſt Letter, becauſe a ſmall Volume of his lately Publiſhed by another Hand, I am informed, has met with good applauſe. This particular Letter I
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:108575:12"/>
thought fit to inſert here, becauſe perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the Subject, and alſo becauſe his manner of Writing, is at once pleaſing, and profitable.</p>

            <head>THE Government OF A WIFE.</head>
            <p>I Lye under the Two powerful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Love and Obedience. I love you, Sir, and you command me. And though the Command you lay on me, be of very difficult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, yet Love and Obedience which have often conquer'd things, in appearance impoſſible, will not refuſe to overcome the greateſt Difficulties.</p>
            <p>You tell me you are upon Marrying, and deſire me to give you ſome Advice, how to behave your ſelf in that New State of Life. I am of opinion, it is harder to find, and there are fewer that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108575:14"/>
will ask, than that are able to give Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>He who deſires and endeavours to be well adviſed, ſeems to ſtand leaſt in need of it; for it is ſo great prudence to take counſel, that I am apt to believe the Man who asks, is moſt capable of governing himſelf without it.</p>
            <p>The firſt Counſel I will give you, is, that you rely not in any point upon my opinion alone: for tho' the Will to ſerve you be not wanting, yet I may perhaps fall ſhort in Underſtanding, to counſel right. It is more rare to find the Will and Underſtanding united, than Honour and Profit: and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, tho' one of the great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Soul, is not infallible in its Direction, being often miſlead through Weakneſs.</p>
            <p>Antiquity has left many profitable Rules for Marryed People to walk by; our Modern Learning has enlarged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or put them into other Language.</p>
            <p>We will take up with a more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſort of Diſcourſe, as the diverſion of the long Winter Nights; in which, I write theſe Rules with an eaſy, and pleaſing Stile, as beſt ſuits with your
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108575:14"/>
Condition and Youth, tho' diſagreeable to my Humor and Fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seneca, Ariſtotle, Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> muſt excuſe me; <hi>Porcia, Caſſandra, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobia</hi> and <hi>Lucretia,</hi> the ſo much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Examples of this kind, muſt not be offended; for I hope, without Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the former, or Actions of the latter, to expreſs what you deſire to hear, and what I deſign to ſay.</p>
            <p>I am at Years of Diſcretion, have been bred in Courts, have Travelled, made Remarks, and remember what I obſerved. I have ſeen, read, and heard. From this Experience will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce my Rules, hence the Examples I ſhall offer: Theſe ſhall be the Books I will Quote; and perhaps ſome Tales I can remember, being here offered, will be no leſs to the purpoſe, and more pleaſing, than the old Stories of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> ſo often ſerved up by thoſe we call Learned, and which as often we are apt to nauſeate.</p>
            <p>It is certain, all Change cauſes a ſtrangeneſs in the Mind. To remove from one Houſe to another, is ſomewhat irkſom. A change of Life, muſt then make a conſiderable Alteration in any Man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:108575:15"/>To ſhun this Strangeneſs, conſider Sir, you were born and bred to this end, to come to this ſtate of Life; and this you long ſince knew, was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition allotted you.</p>
            <p>This State of Life is properly your own, the other was but tending to it. No Man complains, that he is arrived at the end of his Journy.</p>
            <p>Conſider not this as any reſtraint upon your Liberty, but rather as one going up haſtily a ſteep Stair-caſe, wiſhes for a place to reſt; ſo a Man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending this Ladder of Life, the higher he mounts, and the more looſely he lives, the more need he has of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Matrimony, which is therefore called a State and Settlement of Life, as being not only the end tended to, but alſo a condition of Repoſe and Quiet.</p>
            <p>Tho' you have not aſcended many Steps, that is, lived many Years, you have ſtill lived enough; and after ſuch a manner, it is high time to ſeek that Reſt you are coming to, which now comes in a proper ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>The Son marrying, requites the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit he receiv'd of his Father; for had not the Father marryed, he had not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108575:15"/>
been. Thus Men ſucceſſively contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute one to another, and all to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of thoſe who gave them their Being, and to whom they owe the greateſt Obligations next to God.</p>
            <p>Young Men are frighted at the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they hear from people unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately Matched; for it is more natural and common, that good Food ſhould be converted into ill Humors by meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ill Diſpoſition in our Bodies, than that the ill Humors found there, ſhould be changed by the Food into Nouriſhment. Young Men think the Bands of Matrimony inſupportable; they are ſo to thoſe who know not how to wear them, but eaſy to them that do. A ſmall weight on a Man's back is cumberſom, a much greater drawn upon Wheels, is eaſier. The Burthen of Wedlock is not beyond our ſtrength, it generally wants being ſupported by Prudence, and therefore appears the heavier.</p>
            <p>Would you know how light the Burthen of this ſort of Life is? VVeigh it by that you leave; put into the Scale your former Reſtleſsneſs, the Dangers, the Diſguſts, the Diſorders of the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108575:16"/>
that general miſtruſt of all things (that want of Confidence in any body,) Complaints which trouble, Revenge which endangers, Falſhood in Friends which torments, Jealouſy which waſtes, Courtſhip that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes you, the dangers of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the laviſhing of your Health, the expoſing your Life, and the continual remorſe of your Conſcience: then will you rejoice all this is left behind.</p>
            <p>VVere the advantages of VVedlock no other, but that it delivered a Man from ſo many Evils, well might it ſtill merit the Name of a holy and ſweet courſe of Life. Now let us ſee what it is a marryed Man receives, in lieu of his ſo much boaſted of Freedom.</p>
            <p>He is put into a better State of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and is poſſeſſed of a VVoman who depoſites in his hands, her Liberty, her VVill, her Fortune, her Care, her Obedience, her Life, and even her very Soul. VVho is there ſo blind, that weighing what he leaves, and what he receives, will not diſcover how great a Gainer he is by the change?</p>
            <p>One of the circumſtances that moſt contributes towards ſecuring the future
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108575:16"/>
Happineſs of thoſe that Marry, is the due proportion of the Match. Inequality of Birth, of Fortune, of Age, cauſes Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes, and thoſe Diſputes produce Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. This it is that brings on all Troubles, there is no Peace, and the marryed Life is Hell upon Earth.</p>
            <p>For the ſatisfaction of Parents, it is requiſite there be ſome equality in Birth, for the good of the Children, that there be a proportion of Fortunes; and for the ſatisfaction of the Marryed Couple, that there be no diſproportion of Years. It does not follow, that this equality muſt hold between Man and VVife to a day or year, but the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ought not to be exceeding great. VVhat odds there are, ought always to be on the Husbands ſide, who in all reſpects muſt be ſuperior to the VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: yet the greateſt Happineſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conſiſts in the greateſt Equality.</p>
            <p>A great Courtier among us, uſed to ſay, There were three ſorts of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages in the world; a Marriage of God, a Marriage of the Devil, and a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Death. Of God, when a Young Man marries a Young VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Of the Devil, when an Old
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108575:17"/>
VVoman marries a Young Man. And of Death, when an Old Man marries a Young VVoman.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt he was much in the right, for a Young Couple may live with Content. Old VVomen marryed to Young Men, live in perpetual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Old Men marryed to Young VVomen, haſten their own Death, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through Jealouſy, or Exceſs.</p>
            <p>But becauſe theſe things are too vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and the meaneſt capacities have ſome knowledge of them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the judicious, enough; it is time to come to particulars not ſo obvious.</p>
            <p>Know then, Sir, that by VVedlock, another Soul is added to your Soul, and a new Duty is laid upon that which before was incumbent on you: and therefore your care and induſtry ought proportionably to increaſe. Juſt as a Man who having one good Farm which he looked after, and endeavoured to improve; if another happened to fall to him, would endeavour to double his Induſtry, that he might manage both, without expreſſing any concern or trouble: So a Marryed Man, without afflicting himſelf, muſt double his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108575:17"/>
Forecaſt and Care, that he may not be wanting to the new Charge he has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and is lay'd upon him by the VVife he has received; not that he ſhould expoſe and ruin her, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in her, but that he ſhould Live more pleaſant and comfortably with her.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee if it be poſſible to preſcribe ſome rule of Love, which is often what makes Marry'd People moſt Unhappy; ſometimes becauſe it is wanting, and ſometimes becauſe it is exceſſive. Let us at leaſt ſpread the Nets to catch this ſort of prudent Love, and let him fall into the Snare if he will, though it is likelieſt he will fly from it, and that perhaps is the reaſon he is painted with Wings.</p>
            <p>The Wife muſt be belov'd, but not ſo that the Husband be leſſen'd or brought into danger. That ſort of blind Love is only fit for Miſtreſſes, the Love of a Wife muſt have Eyes. Let him either recover his own, or borrow ſight from the Underſtanding, which can plentifully ſupply him.</p>
            <p>It is then a Man is leſſen'd by his Wife, when he forfeits his Authority, and expoſes his Reputation, rather than
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108575:18"/>
contradict her will; in ſuch caſes where it is reaſonable, ſhe ſhould be contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. It is equally dangerous to imitate <hi>Narciſſus</hi> in loving another, as in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring ones ſelf.</p>
            <p>Certain Cardinals highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Pope <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> a Servant he had whom he much favour'd, the Pope anſwer'd, he is a good Servant, but never contradicts me. It is rather the perfection of Love, than any want of affection, to curb the will of the loved object, when bent upon things not fit to be allow'd.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Men who have ſo little Sence, they boaſt of their Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. It is an equal ſhame for a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd Man to let it be known his Wife commands him; or that he makes her his Slave, and not his Companion.</p>
            <p>The Priviledge and the Authority that belongs to each, ought of right to be ſetled and made known at firſt. The Husband muſt be like the Sun in his Houſe, the Wife like the Moon; what light ſhe gives, muſt be borrowed from him, but ſhe muſt never ſuffer an Eclipſe. He muſt Govern with abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power, and his reſpect muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108575:18"/>
her Authority. She muſt fear him, and he muſt cauſe all to fear her, then both will be Obeyed.</p>
            <p>In my Opinion Women are like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, their Price is enhanſed or abaſed according to the account we make of them.</p>
            <p>Such as Marry Women above them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in both Fortune or Knowledg, are expoſed to great danger. God has delivered you from this danger, Sir, (and all that Marry as you have done) becauſe you two are equal in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, wherein there ought to be equality between Man and Wife, and you are ſuperior in thoſe points you ought to be ſo in. Elderſhip is a good pledge on the Husbands ſide, to ſecure his Prerogative.</p>
            <p>I will not ſtay to preſcribe Remedies for preventing theſe dangers, for it is not my deſign to give counſel how to chuſe a Wife, but how to live with her already choſen.</p>
            <p>He who Marries a Young Wife, has already half compaſſed his ends: Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Years are free from ill Cuſtoms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch as are there, having taken no Root, are eaſily removed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:108575:19"/>A Man accuſing his Wife for her ill Qualities before his Prince, was ask'd by him, at what Age he Marry'd her? The Husband ſaying, at Twelve Years of Age; the King reply'd, Then it is you that ought to be puniſhed, for Breeding her ſo ill.</p>
            <p>A Young Lion is eaſily tamed. A Bird grows fond of the very Wires of the Cage that confines him; whereas naturally the former is fierce, and the latter free. Education is a ſecond Birth, and if it differ from the firſt in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, it is only that the ſecond is the more prevalent.</p>
            <p>A Man of Senſe and Judgment Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a Woman at that Age, muſt imagin he is to be his VVifes Father as well as Husband. He may cauſe her to be born again in new Conditions: Since we ſee a Bear, being a Beaſt ſo unweildy that it ſeems not to know how to go upon the ground, Dance upon a Rope; who can deſpair of infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the good cuſtoms, and qualities into a Young VVoman that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhall propoſe? And what reaſon is there to imagin, ſhe will not follow and Suck in the bad, if the Husband
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108575:19"/>
leads her into, and gives her an example to continue in them?</p>
            <p>Very Young VVomen are in ſome danger, through the extraordinary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection they bear towards their Parents and Brothers; and the ill conſequences of this inordinate affection are the more to be feared, by how much they are the more plauſible. This affection is generally to be regulated by the merits of the Parents and Relations. VVhen Parents are ſuch as they ought to be, it is commendable; when otherwiſe, it is requiſite that Familiarity be preſently, with decency broke off. Above all, in Marry'd VVomen, I would rather ſee reſpect for their Parents, than Love, not wholly to exclude it; for there is no true Obedience without ſome Love: But in caſe it be too much Love, and they not worthy of it, the remedy is not very difficult, if there be addreſs and policy in the Husband.</p>
            <p>Towards the compaſſing this end, it is convenient the Husband apply freſh endearment and attractives, and that he Court and Sooth his Wife as much more as would be neceſſary, were this occaſion taken away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:108575:20"/>The Child that knows no other ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance but the Mothers Breſt, leaves it for Honey or Sugar which it finds ſweeter than the Milk. The Love of a Husband is more agreeable to a VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, than that of her Parents and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, thence it follows, that a VVife being cheriſhed and oblig'd by the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, eaſily forgets Father, Mother, Brothers, and all the VVorld for him.</p>
            <p>This endearment ought to be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with diſcretion, and be carried on with Actions as well as VVords. A Gown or Petticoat not ask'd, ſome Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity unexpected, an Entertainment abroad not thought of, ſtaying at home ſome Evening, coming home early ſome Night, and perhaps Riſing late ſome Morning, are the things that will make way towards her forgetting the uſual fondneſs towards Parents, when it ſo behoves the Husband.</p>
            <p>Some have doubted whether there could be true Love between thoſe who Marrry'd for conveniency, and with formal Articles; and believed this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect union was reſerved only for thoſe who Marry for Love. To this effect a pleaſant Gentleman being ſollicited by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108575:20"/>
a Kinſwoman to Marry for convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, anſwer'd her; Madam, I cannot promiſe to ſecure my Love to any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by Articles before a Notary, but by my own inclination.</p>
            <p>There are good and bad Examples enough of both Kinds; but I being more fond of Reaſon than Chance, will give my Opinion in this caſe, tho' to ſome it may appear new.</p>
            <p>I am perſwaded, this thing the world calls Love, is not only one, but ſeveral diſtinct Beings under the ſame Name. This perhaps may be the reaſon, the Antients; feigned ſo many <hi>Loves</hi> or <hi>Cupids,</hi> to each whereof they aſcribed a ſeveral Birth; and this perhaps, might give occaſion to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſpeak of Love in the Plural Number, calling it <hi>Amores,</hi> which if but one, would be very improper. I ſuppoſe, two ſorts of Love: The firſt is, that common Sympathy or Affection, which of its own natural Force (without any Reaſon) carries us away to Love we know not what, nor why: The ſecond is, that which continues our Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and good Will to thoſe Objects we know and converſe with. The firſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108575:21"/>
ends in the poſſeſſion of the Object de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. The ſecond begins there; but in ſuch manner, that neither does the firſt always produce the ſecond, nor does the ſecond always proceed from the firſt.</p>
            <p>Hence I infer, that the love produced by Cohabitation, Familiarity and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Duty, between Marryed People, to be ſincere and perfect; has no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on that other ſort of love, which ſprung from the Deſires or extravagant Appetite of thoſe, who before diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected one another, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Being in Love;</hi> and this ſort of Inclination being often (if not counterfeit) only the unconſiderate effect of Youth, has proved rather hurtful than beneficial.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is not to be doubted, this miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Deſire which is alſo miſcalled Love, being ill grounded, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rather the name of a vicious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, expires in the poſſeſſion of the Object, becauſe it had no other Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation but the ſatisfying an Appetite, which once taſting what it moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deſired, ſoon Surfeits, and ever has a Loathing, and nauſeates that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108575:21"/>
Delight it ſo greedily took the firſt fill of. But, where a ſincere love is ſetled upon ſolid grounds, a reciprocal Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, mature Reflection, ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Judgment to diſcern, and an eſteem of good Qualities and natural Perfections, as well as exterior Form, and a fading Complection; that love, I ſay, muſt of neceſſity be laſting, will need no Arts to ſupport it, and will like the <hi>Phenix,</hi> be ſtill ſweetly burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for to riſe the more vigorous and glorious out of its own Aſhes. Let none object, that Love is Blind, and cannot uſe ſo much precaution. It is our vile Appetite which is blind, and to which we unjuſtly give the name of Love. True Love is very clear-ſighted, diſcreet and judicious, and meaſures all its Actions by the Rules of Honour and Reaſon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is hard to conceive, how we can truly love a Perſon we never ſaw. Much may be ſaid touching this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but it belongs not to this place. In this caſe, we muſt do like thoſe who cut Timber, and caſt it into a River to be carryed by the Stream (without any labour) to the place they deſign: they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108575:22"/>
know not which way their Timber goes, but are ſatisfyed it will come ſafe, by what has been ſent the ſame way before, and therefore confidently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to the water. Let the Husband ſuffer himſelf to be carryed away by that vertuous cuſtom; let him not ſtrive againſt the Stream; for when he leaſt thinks of it, and without knowing how it came to paſs, he will find, he loves his Wife intirely, and is recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally beloved by her.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This Poſition will ſound very harſh in the Ears of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, and not without reaſon; nor can I in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner approve of it. The cuſtom of keeping Women mewed up in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> is the occaſion our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor gives this Advice, ſuitable to the place where he writ. But, we muſt not therefore conclude, it is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of only thoſe Countries, to take Wives at a venture. All the Great Men of the VVorld uſe it; Kings and Princes ſeldom or never, ſee their Conſorts till ſecured; and this cuſtom has deſcended to all Men of any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Fortunes, who are often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to Women at a great diſtance,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108575:22"/>
and all the ſight they obtain of them, is a Picture, in which the Painter ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſes his Art than her Face, and is obliged to Flatter, to enhance his Reward. And to ſay the truth, where conveniency and intereſt is the Aim, it is indifferent whether a Man ſees the Woman or not, ſince it is not Her he Marries, but his Intereſt. If ſhe is Beautiful, he ſtands not to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine her Qualities; if ſhe is never ſo much Deformed, he is ſatisfyed, ſo the Portion be agreeable. Therefore we muſt not look upon this cuſtom of not ſeeing the Women, as only uſual in other Countries; it is too much the Practice of our own. I muſt avow, I can no way approve of it, being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the occaſion of ſo many unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Matches, as may be obvious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſcending to particular Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which would be endleſs; for it is viſible, that few of the greateſt Men, and they are generally Marryed after this manner, have no more eſteem for their VVives than what Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſuperficially obliges them to. Few love, moſt for ſhame ſtrive to be Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to them. But let us return to our Author:</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:108575:23"/>Let the VVife be made ſenſible, it is her Duty to love her Husband above all things. Let the Husband underſtand, he muſt be moſt in love with his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and next with his VVife.</p>
            <p>There is an antient <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Proverb that ſays, <hi>She who has no Husband, has no Friend.</hi> And another ſays, <hi>He who has a Wife, has all he wants.</hi> This is verify'd in every happy Couple. Proverbs are Sentences full of Truth, which Experience has put into the mouths of the People.</p>
            <p>But, becauſe it happens that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all precautions, when God will puniſh us with the Croſs or Shame of a Woman of perverſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; ſhe ſtruggles to maintain her ſelf in her Diſorders. We will diſcourſe of the ill Qualities they are generally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, that fit Remedies may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to them all: Yet it muſt not be hoped, that all Women are in a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of being Cured.</p>
            <p>Some Women believe, that becauſe they are true to their Marriage-bed, their Husbands are obliged in all other reſpects, to bear with whatſoever they will impoſe upon them. This is a very
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108575:23"/>
groſs miſtake, for two Reaſons: The firſt, becauſe a Husband is no way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to an honeſt Woman, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Duty ſhe owes to God, to Nature, to her Fame, and even to her Safety.</p>
            <p>I remember that being at <hi>Madrid,</hi> I had a Neighbour a high ſpirited Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who quarrelling one day (as ſhe always us'd to do,) ſtill buzz'd in her Husbands Ears, <hi>Sir, I am very Honeſt.</hi> And he replyed, <hi>Then ask your Reward of God Almighty, for it lyes not upon me to requite you for being ſo, but to puniſh you if you are not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe the Honour of the Husband is not only loſt by Incontinency, but by many other Perils, to which they expoſe Men by their Extravagancies. It was therefore a witty, but not a true Saying, of one who affirmed, <hi>That no Man had more need of Patience, than he who had a good Wife, a good Servant, and a good Horſe; for that each of them ſenſible of their own Value, followed their own Will, and not that of the Maſter or Owner.</hi> On the ſame reaſon perhaps, was grounded that waggiſh <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Saying; <hi>A good
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108575:24"/>
Mule, a good Goat, and a good Woman, are three ſcurvy Beaſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Imperious and high Spirited Women are the hardeſt to be reclaimed, becauſe they grow more haughty upon the meekneſs of a Husband, which ought to be their only cure: it being always known, that the Proud are more inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent where they find Humility, and the Outragious grow more fierce at the ſight of Mildneſs. Among People of Credit, no force or violence can be uſed. This gave occaſion to a Wiſe Man to ſay, <hi>That among other things, the Commonalty had wreſted from the Gentry, one was the priviledge of correcting their Wives whenſoever they deſerved it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It requires a great deal of Prudence, to curb Women of this Temper. I would adviſe thoſe who are under ſuch unhappy circumſtances, to avoid as much as may be, living in Courts and great Towns. Thoſe who make a noiſe in a Deſert, are leaſt heard. This will put a ſtop to many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: and a Man will avoid becoming the Town-talk; for the Actions of ſuch unhappy Couples, are the common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Cenſorious Tongues. This is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108575:24"/>
no ſmall Reflection on the Husband, and is in ſome meaſure an Affront al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſounding in his Ears, no leſs than the Voice of his noiſy Wife.</p>
            <p>An ugly Wife is a common Trouble, but may be eaſed many times in a day; that is, as often as the Husband goes out of her ſight, or ſhe out of his. Let him conſider, the ſecurity of his Thoughts is of much more value than the pleaſure of his Eyes. Let him reſt ſatisfyed in this Security, and perſwade himſelf, the difference is not much between lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all Beauty at once, and ſeeing it daily decay, which is no ſmall Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him that loves. All Women are ſubject to this Decay, either by Age, Sickneſs, or other Misfortunes incident to them. This made an ingenious Man complain, <hi>Not that Nature cut off, but that it made Beauties grow old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He who has a Deformed Wife, has the leaſt cauſe to complain of any Man, or if he does, it ought to be only of himſelf. Other Imperfections may be hid; Beauty and Deformity are too viſible to be impoſed upon any Man. If he ſaw not the Wife before Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, he was in the wrong to take her
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108575:25"/>
at a venture; were he to buy a Horſe, he would doubtleſs ſee him firſt. If he ſaw, and liked, his Fault is greater in being ſo changeable to reject now, what then he approved of. If Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and Intereſt prevailed above the conſideration of Form, his Crime is greateſt, in ſelling his Satisfaction firſt, and not prizing afterwards the poor Creature has purchas'd him at a dear rate. Theſe conſiderations ſhould ſtir him up to Love and Reſpect; but if they are not of force enough, let him look thro' thoſe exterior Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; he may perhaps, diſcover the Beauties of a Soul far tranſcending all thoſe of the Body. When Nature is defective in one part, it for the moſt part makes amends in another. It is uſual for ſome Men with one Eye, to ſee more than others with two. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Beautiful Bodies have deformed Souls; and the contrary, this latter is the moſt perfect Beauty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A fooliſh Woman is troubleſom, but not intollerable. The Husband muſt endeavour to lend as much of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion towards directing the Actions of his Wife, as he ſees ſhe wants. A
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108575:25"/>
Man of ſenſe will obſerve this method; but if he have as little as ſhe, her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will never trouble him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Few Men will be ſo mad to marry a meer Natural: for the reſt, if a Woman has ſence enough to preſerve her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the Husband had better bear with Simplicity and Innocence, which may be guided and informed, than with the incorrigible Humors and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Women, puffed up with the conceit of their Wit, Diſcretion and Parts. It is certain, the Pride of their own Abilities has debauched more Women, and diſhonoured more Men, than ever could be reckon'd to ſuffer damage by Ignorance or want of Judgment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sickneſs, which ſhe is ſubject to, is alſo a great Affliction. It is a grief to ſee the Perſon beloved languiſh, and it is often they that deſerve it leaſt; for Good and Evil has always been very unequally diſtributed in this VVorld. A Sick Wife muſt be treated with all deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy imaginable, and her Humours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated with all poſſible Patience. A Man may make this account, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing decreed one half of him muſt ſuffer;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108575:26"/>
it is a Mercy of God, it ſhould fall upon that half which will be leaſt miſſed in his Family. Let him conſider, it is the Duty of a faithful Companion, to ſtick by his Company in the bad as well as the good way. If the Scale were turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Husband would deſire to be treated in the ſame manner by his Wife.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Women extravagant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impertinent, and never to be pleaſed; all their uneaſineſs falls upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to whom they become inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: ſo the Houſe gets an ill Name, and the Maſter can ſcarce find any body that will ſerve him. It is requiſite theſe Women be held in, and their Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained; that like People labouring under ſome infectious Diſtemper, they be ſerved at a diſtance, that little ear be given, and leſs ſaid to them. Let them feel the effects of their ill Humours, by leaving them without the neceſſary At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance; for if this will not reduce them, any other Remedy is hard to be found, and the innocent Husband ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers for the peeviſhneſs of his ill natur'd Wife, that has gained the ill-will of the Servants, who want Diſcretion to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the Actions of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108575:26"/>
one and the other, and conſequently which of them merits their Love, and which their Hate.</p>
            <p>Some Women are penurious, and this is one of the ſmalleſt Faults they are ſubject to. I do not look upon it of any dangerous conſequence (tho' it may breed ſome Diſcontent;) for if the Husband is generous, he will remedy the fault of the Wife; and if like her, they will live in miſery, but with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. I think, all the cunning Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliphicks of <hi>Egypt</hi> have not a more wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Simile, than our <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Proverb, <hi>The Husband a Boat, the Wife a Cheſt.</hi> I had it long ſince from an Old Woman, and obſerved it as if it had been from a Learned Man. The Husband muſt bring in, and the Wife muſt keep.</p>
            <p>A Jealous Wife is very apt to cauſe Diſcontent. A Man of Judgment uſed to ſay, <hi>Keep a Jealous Wife idle:</hi> that is, give her no occaſion, and ſhe will not ſeek it. He did not diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a juſt cauſe of Complaint, and a groundleſs Jealouſy; for I call not her Jealous, whoſe Diſcontent proceeds from open Wrongs. Thoſe are Jealous who complain without cauſe, and they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108575:27"/>
are the troubleſom Women: For it is difficult, but not impoſſible to any Man, to mend his own Faults; but to correct thoſe of others, is not difficult, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. The beſt Remedy againſt a Jealous Wife, is to give her no occaſion, and that will ſecure both Honour and Conſcience. Thoſe that are Jealous with cauſe, are cured of their Jealouſy, by the Husbands curing himſelf of his Failing As for light Suſpitions, which an ingenious Man called, <hi>The Itch of Love,</hi> for that they are at once painful and pleaſant; the ſame Medicines that were applyed to a Miſtreſs, will heal a Wife of them: That inordinate Paſſion is moſt fierce, and therefore the Jealouſy proceeds from it the more violent, (as the beſt Vinegar is made of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Wine:) Therefore, he who knew how to divert the Jealouſy of a Miſtreſs, when he had one, may by the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, remove the Jealouſy of his Wife when Marryed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Tho' it be uneaſy to ſee a Woman Jealous without cauſe, there is ſtill that comfort in it, It is the effect of Love; and a Husband may the better bear with that Failing, conſidering it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108575:27"/>
as a demonſtration of Affection in his Wife. Let him apply ſoft Medicines, continual Endearments, and conſtant Kindneſs, will probably reclaim any reaſonable Woman. If her madneſs be not otherwiſe curable, a harſh Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may, ſometimes applyed with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, have a good effect. I will not attempt to preſcribe it, but give this Example: A Gentleman who kept unſeaſonable hours, at his coming home, always found his Wife up, ſhe grew Sickly, and Pined; not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the reaſon, he one day called a Servant that attended on her, and what by Threats, what by fair Means, brought her to confeſs, her Miſtreſs every night followed him till ſhe ſaw him Hous'd; and that with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of walking the Streets, the cold Nights, and vexing at home, ſhe was reduced to that condition. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman charged the Maid to keep counſel, and took no notice of what he had heard; but the following night went out as uſual, and knowing her to be at his Heels, walked the Streets till near Morning; ſhe ſtill purſuing him. He went home; the Wife per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108575:28"/>
by his Ramble, ſhe was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, never more offered to follow him, and he for the future kept better Hours.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next that come in the way, are the Extravagant waſteful Women, the devouring flame of Houſes and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. This is a moſt Pernicious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe it carries ſome ſhadow of Goodneſs, and is much applauded. A Woman ought to handle Money with as much caution as ſhe would a Sword, or Fire, or any other thing ſhe ought to be afraid of. Money in the hands of a Woman, is as unbecoming as a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. If a Marryed Woman of her ſelf, has not ſufficient Authority to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a Servant, how can ſhe pretend to diſpoſe of her Subſtance, in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the Welfare and Happineſs of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Servants. Much caution and diſcretion is requiſite, to manage one of theſe Women: for as in a Ship at Sea, the ſpringing a Leak, becauſe Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water is more dangerous, than if many Breaches were made upon the Deck, or Sides of the Ship that bear above the Sea; ſo no other defect is equally dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as the profuſeneſs of a Wife,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108575:28"/>
becauſe it is a fault Under-water, it ruines the main Stoek, and the Family muſt inevitably Periſh. There are ſome of theſe who will Mortgage an Eſtate, to gratify a Humor, or pleaſe their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. Not only great Ladies are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this Folly (for in them it is leſs dangerous, and therefore more excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,) but even very ordinary People. When I was at <hi>Madrid,</hi> there came to the Houſe where I lay, a Labourers Wife, begging very earneſtly, they would lend her twelve Royals upon a pair of Sheets; and being asked, <hi>What was her great want?</hi> ſhe anſwered, <hi>Good Lord! Gentlemen, I haue agreed for half a dozen of Jet-hands,</hi> (they are Baubles uſually hung about Childrens Neck, to preſerve them from ill Eyes, as they ſay,) <hi>and if I miſs of them now, I know not when they may be had again.</hi> Such a fancy, if not cuſtomary, is the more tolerable. It is more excuſable in Youth, in a Married Woman leſs to be born. Let every Woman conſider, the World is greater than her Appetite, that ſhe may not pretend to want all ſhe ſees and hears. God deliver us from thoſe who verify that Proverb, <hi>My
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108575:29"/>
Daughters Eyes cover all ſhe Spies.</hi> Theſe VVomen muſt be put in mind, they are firſt to have regard to their Duty, next to Temperance, and after theſe may be allowed to look to their Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay of thoſe wilful VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who will be poſitive and abſolute in their Opinions: theſe for the moſt part, are either very Fooliſh or very Proud. I cannot allow of arguing with a VVife, for this is granting them an equality of Judgment and Authority, which muſt be carefully avoided. She muſt be made ſenſible, it is not her part to underſtand, but to obey, and to be lead, not to lead. Let her ſometimes be put in mind, that having in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age reſigned her VVill to her Husband, it is now a Crime to make uſe of what is not her own.</p>
            <p>
               <q>There is no doubt, my Author has incurred the diſpleaſure of all the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Sex, by ſeeming to debar them the handling and diſpoſing of Money, which they eſteem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108575:29"/>
prodigal Women, ſuch as have no regard to the welfare of Husband and Family, ſo they gratify their own profuſe appetite. Such Wives cannot certainly be too ſeverely Curb'd. We think it not ſtrange that Children and Fools, ſhould have Tutors or Keepers, and be debarred the extravagant uſe of Money. Why then if a Marry'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtill continues in her Minority, and never recovers Senſe enough to moderate her Expences; ſhall not a Husband take upon him to be her Guardian, her Tutor, and her Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? I Knew a Lady, who having waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Husband's Eſtate, and drown'd his Credit by Gaming, was ſtill ſo fond of that deſtructive Devil, ſhe would play with her Servants, and loſe her wearing Apparel. I have ſeen another Pawn her Husband's Cloaths, to appear Splendid abroad, and even her own Gown, to go to a Play. What Reſtraint, what Rigor is too great for ſuch Monſters as theſe?

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:108575:30"/>All theſe Faults are nothing, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Lightneſs, and Immodeſty; I dare not ſpeak it out, becauſe I find not a Word decent enough to expreſs it. There is a ſort of vain looſe, and faithleſs VVomen, that are led away by every VVind that blows, and this is the greateſt of all other Evils. I will not Diſcourſe of it, for it is needleſs to aſſign any Remedy in that caſe. Let every Man's Honour and Conſcience be his Counſeller, under theſe Unhappy Circumſtances. An Ingenious Man very VVittily determined this Point in few words thus: <hi>Let the Husband take all things from his Wife, but wrongs of Honour; and the Wife Marriage, Wrongs and all:</hi> Yet I muſt obſerve, it is of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence to allow of that Pretence of their's, That there is no harm in VVit and Gallantry. This is a Practice brought up to Diſguiſe Leudneſs, and no way Juſtifiable. It is uſual to make way with a Gimlet, before we drive a Nail; no Vice takes poſſeſſion on the Soul all at once. That Inſect which in <hi>Braſil</hi> cauſes Sickneſs, may ſerve as an Example to all the VVorld. It enters inviſibly, is at firſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108575:31"/>
but a Paſtime, grows troubleſom, paſſes to be a Diſeaſe, and may prove dangerous. A VVomans Honour may be compared to Arithmetick; it is as bad to be out in one as in a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. Let Honeſt VVomen Ballance their Accounts, and they will find this a ſure Reckoning.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Cuſtom in <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſome other Countries, has made it ſafe for a Man to Kill his VVife, if ſhe is falſe to him; the Law is not poſitive for it, but the Practice is frequent, and tolerated. The Law of God does not allow it, yet we find the <hi>Levitical</hi> ordains a VVoman Convicted of Adultery to be Ston'd to Death by the People. The Husband is not here allow'd to be Judge and Executioner in his own Cauſe, but yet Death we ſee is the Puniſhment of that Crime. If the Law of the Land did allow it, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it were no Offence then before God, for the Husband to be the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner; for ſince God adjudged the Crime to deſerve Death, it is doubtleſs indifferent who Executes the Sentence. If this power were Inveſted in the Husband, the terror
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108575:31"/>
of it would prevent much ſcandalous lewdneſs, which now Triumphs barefac'd. No Advice can be given to a Man under this moſt Unhappy Circumſtance. He muſt ſummon all his Diſcretion, and all his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he muſt Steer ſteadily between Honour and Conſcience, and let them both direct his Actions. That moſt pernicious Liberty, Women pretend to of Wit, and Rallery; ought by all Men of Sence to be carefully cut off, as infamous and abominable. It is either a Diſguiſe, or Introduction to Lewdneſs, and Debauchery. The Woman that haunts the Doors of Chocolate-Houſes in a Hackney-Coach, to be thought a Wit, that ſits with a Mask in the Pit to rally the Beau's, that Laughs and Talks loud in the Boxes, and Diſguiſes her ſelf to be Pick'd up in the Galleries, if ſhe is not already loſt, is a Riding Poſt on the High-way to Perdition. The Husband who knows (and unleſs he will, he cannot be Ignorant) and bears with this, deſerves all the Plagues and Miſeries that follow an Infamous and Lewd Wife. If kindneſs and fair
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108575:32"/>
means will not prevail to reclaim a Woman before this becomes habitual, there is no rigour or ſeverity ſo great, but is yet too little to correct and keep her under.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It will not be proper to paſs by ſome, who value themſelves on their Beauty: It is no crime in a Woman to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of her worth; I have often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it: It is as requiſite we ſhould underſtand what we poſſeſs that is good; as what there is ill in us; that we may preſerve the former, and correct and put a ſtop to the latter. Beauty ſhould be uſed like Quality; every Body may rejoyce they have it, but need not make it their Buſineſs to proclaim it. It is a madneſs for a Man to draw his Sword upon every trifle. The Husband whoſe Wife is infected with this ſort of vain Glory, muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve he deals in a dangerous Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; for this Female-Ware is contrary to all other Merchandiſe, and the more it is coveted, is the leſs to be valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Therefore ſome have doubted, whether Beauty were given as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:108575:32"/>We are got out of this intricate La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth, and have overcome the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that ſurround it. All theſe are to be met with in the VVorld, but a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Man will ſtill be ſafe. VVe ſee in Sea-charts the Sands Seamen are to ſhun, are as carefully ſet down, as the Ports they are to Anchor in. Having ſhowed ſome Shadows of the Perils and Inconveniences cauſed by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of VVomen, I have as good as diſcovered the Satisfaction and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that attends a good one: And indeed that Bleſſing is ſo great, it is not to be expreſſed. All Praiſes are too little for a Virtuous VVoman, and therefore the Husband ought to treat her as a Heavenly Gift. I will briefly touch ſome Rules that muſt be, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned, but well practiſed, in order to preſerve your Honour, and your VVife, on which that has ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance. It is not enough to plant Myrtle in a Garden to adorn it, and that it may form pleaſing and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Figures; the ſmall Boughs muſt be twiſted, and the irreguler Branches cut, and all will not do, unleſs the Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be continually Trimming and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108575:33"/>
of it, for it ſprouts and grows out of form.</p>
            <p>The Cuſtom of taking of ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for the Maſter, and others for the Miſtreſs, ought to be carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. VVedlock is the Union of two why then ſhould they divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: It is eaſier to give this Advice, than perſwade the Practice of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would not quite paſs by, nor will I inſiſt upon it.</p>
            <p>It is now look'd upon as Grandeur, to have ſeperate Lodgings and Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſome Marry'd People obſerve this State as long as they Live, and ſome Husbands abſtain from their own VVives, more than from thoſe of their Neighbours. In this caſe, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the VValls of the moſt Ancient Buildings, and they will inform us what the Cuſtom was then. VVe ſhall ſee that the Houſe which then contained a great Lord, is now too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for an overgrown Yeoman. I am not ſo fond of Antiquity, as raſhly to cry up all that was then in uſe, but I highly approve of the plain Way of Living, not of formality and reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. All the Rooms, all the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108575:33"/>
ought to be in common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Man and VVife; the contrary is a very dangerous abuſe.</p>
            <p>To allow of Favourites or Confidents in a Houſe, who think their Duty is confin'd to the Miſtreſs, that they are oblig'd only to keep her Secrets, to ſerve and pleaſe her alone, that from her they muſt expect their Reward, and only fear her Diſpleaſure, is an overſight which may prove of very dangerous conſequence. Great Men us'd to ſay, the more Servants the more Enemies; and it is a ſaying of the Holy Scripture. There is alſo a ſort of Hangers on, which are, and are not Servants, and theſe are the worſt, and moſt pernicious of Houſhold Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Cuſtom, or rather the Devil has brought up a kind of little privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Pages. The uſe of them is by no means to be tolerated, they have continually acceſs to their Lady upon all occaſions, they are ſubtle and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and under the ſhadow of favour, grow wicked and deſigning. The Pages ought all to belong to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; ſuch as are modeſt, and have good Education, may wait upon the Lady,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108575:34"/>
and it will be convenient to change them: Experience teaches this Method to be ſafer than the contrary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there needs no other perſwaſion to back it, every one will follow that courſe he finds moſt convenient. Pages are to be kept at a diſtance, ſeldom ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and only into ſuch Rooms as are common to all Servants, becauſe if they are little, they carry Meſſages to the Maid Servants, and Solicit for others, I will not give a courſer Name; if great, they plead their own cauſe, and either may redound to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Family.</p>
            <p>The Old Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> ſeeing an overgrown Page going into the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Apartment, he call'd him and ſaid, <hi>Go bid the Steward either Geld you, or ſecure your Eſcape;</hi> he meant if he were not Gelt, he muſt fly, or his Life would be in danger for that familiarity with the Women.</p>
            <p>A Misfortune happened in a Ladies Houſe, and it fell out ſo unſeaſonably, that they were forc'd to ſend for the Midwife for one of her Servants late at Night, the Meſſenger cry'd out loud in the Street, as he thought, the more to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108575:34"/>
palliate the thing, <hi>Miſtreſs Midwife make haſt to ſuch a Ladies Houſe, for one of her Governants is in Labour.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, what a Proclamation to be made in a Street. Who could be ſo much blamed for the diſhonour of that Houſe, as the Maſter of it? When a Heath takes Fire, they ſweep the ways that be between the Buſhes, that no Straw, Stubble or Shrub may convey the Fire acroſs. Theſe Straws, Shrubs and Twigs often raiſe great Conflagrations. Let the Houſe be always clean, and well ſwept, it is not only cleanlineſs, but a great eaſe.</p>
            <p>I muſt ſpeak of Female Servants, and would be glad to whiſper, if Writing could be raiſed higher, and ſunk lower as the Voice can: As to the Number, every one muſt proportion it to his Quality, and have a care of exceeding his Fortune. The Cuſtom of other Countries in this particular, is to be preferred before that of <hi>Spain,</hi> there Ladies of great Quality do not keep above 2 or 3 Maids about them. I had as good here as elſewhere, whilſt I think of it, tell you a witty Saying I heard from a famous Preacher? it is this, He
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108575:35"/>
who ſpends leſs than he has is a Wiſe Man, he who ſpends what he has is a Chriſtian, and he who ſpends more than he has is a Thief. In a well Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd Family, there ſhould be no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in any particular; and if there muſt be a Want, let it be of that which is leaſt viſible, ſuch as Maid Servants, for they ought to be leaſt ſeen in the Houſe, but not the moſt unfit for ſight. If it were only to prevent the trouble they are to a Family, we ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to have as few of them as may be. It is not convenient the Lady have any particular Favourite, they muſt be all equal in her eſteem, ſtill with reſpect to their degree. All muſt love her, ſhe be kind to all, they all be Servants, ſhe Miſtreſs of them all; let her not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Friend, or Companion to any.</p>
            <p>I muſt needs tell you a Story, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, but do not force it upon you. A great Man, very Wiſe and politick told me, That as ſoon as his Wife began to favour one Maid more than another, if Young, he made Love to her, till the good Lady growing Jealous, turn'd her off, or at leaſt did no longer favour
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108575:35"/>
her; if old, he Bought her with Money and Gifts, and then the Lady being ſuſpicious could not endure her. This diſtracted the VVife, and pleaſed the Husband, ſo that ſhe perceiving it at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ength, never gave more Countenance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108575:36"/>
whoſe Husbands have been gone many Years ago for <hi>India,</hi> none of theſe ſorts are ſafe, and perhaps nothing they ſay true. Theſe VVomen are commonly VVits, underſtand Muſick Act and Mimick what they ſee, bring up new Faſhions, are great Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, fine Semſtreſſes, and with ſuch like Charms bewitch their Ladies; who not reflecting upon the hidden Danger are eaſily drawn into their Snare; they are cheriſhed and eſteemed, and then lift themſelves above their Fellow Servants; thus the Houſe is put into confuſion, and yet this perhaps is but the leaſt part of the harm. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſtrange Intrigues to their Ladies, often ſhow them how to overcome Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and bring Examples of ſuch caſes; in fine, they are like the Itch of Honour, which being a baſe and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Diſtemper, is yet by ſome counted pleaſant, and does a delightful harm to the Perſon it has taken poſſeſſion of. It is worth Conſideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is convenient to be ſerved by Perſons of great Abilities and Parts; if of known Probity, it were not amiſs. Yet we ſee the greateſt danger is in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108575:36"/>
them; for Fortune is always at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Nature; whom one favours, the other always ſlights. A Friend of mine very well expreſſes this; writing <hi>That Muſick, Poetry, Valour and Love are the four ſides of Folly, not but each of them is commendable:</hi> but, becauſe theſe and the like good Parts are the Lot of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in other reſpects inconſiderable, and of weak and ſlender Judgments. When the VVife ſignifies a deſire of entertaining ſuch Perſons in her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the Husband may obſtruct it with Courteſy and Kindneſs, ſo that he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeem to divert, than oppoſe it. He may tell, her Laces are to be had at the Exchange; they who make the Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, have the neweſt Faſhions, and all things are bought cheaper than made; for nothing is good or cheap, that is purchaſed with uneaſineſs and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>The beſt ſort of Servants are the Daughters of thoſe that have ſerved in the Family, of whoſe Affection and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, Proofs have been given; the Children of Tenants, or Neighbours, people that have been long known; all of that Rank of people that are not, nor
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108575:37"/>
ought to be aſhamed to ſerve, and by whom the Miſtreſs may without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret or Vanity, expect to be attended.</p>
            <p>There are certain VVomen in the VVorld that are taken in as Gueſts, to keep them from harm. I will never encourage Entertaining of them. Many Ladies are proud to protect ſuch VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in their Houſes. I would not be againſt doing Good, but it is an undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Charity, to take burning Coals out of the Fire that they may not be conſumed, and put them into ones Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to burn it. This is not ſo general a Rule, but the Husband as he finds oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, may diſpence with it.</p>
            <p>In our days, contrary to the antient Practice, it is grown a Cuſtom, for the VVomen-Servants to be as well Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as their Miſtreſſes. They uſe Policy, perſwading their poor Ladies (whom thereby they make poorer) that it is for their Credit their Attendance ſhould be as well Apparrelled as themſelves, and bring Examples of others of leſs Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whoſe Maids are better Cloathed. Thus it often happens, the Miſtreſs is not known from the Maid; and the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take is much more excuſable, than that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108575:37"/>
they ſay was made by a Tenant of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, who was very Young and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Marryed. The Tenants coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the room where the Bride and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom lay, and perceiving no difference between them, the Hair of both being Plaited, and neither having any Beard, he innocently asked, <hi>Which of the two was the Bridegroom? for to him he would deliver his Meſſage:</hi> With how much more reaſon might more judicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons now a-days, ſeeing Miſtreſſes and Servants in the ſame Dreſs, ask, <hi>Which was the Lady?</hi> The leaſt inconveniency this Cuſtom brings, is the exceſſive Charge, which yet is ſuch, that if we conſider the care and trouble ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters go through, to ſupport the Vanity of their Servants, the Slavery of the former is much greater in providing for the latter, than theirs in ſerving the others.</p>
            <p>Experience teaches us, of how ill conſequence this Extravagancy in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Apparel, generally is: they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves ſo Gay, grow Proud, and endeavour to improve the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to make their Fortunes, and ſtrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by thoſe means to better themſelves,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108575:38"/>
often run into ruin: it is the Husband's buſineſs, to appoint what rate the Ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parel of each muſt bear; Women muſt be allowed all Neatneſs and Decency but not all manner of Gaudineſs; every Servant muſt be Cloathed according to her Place.</p>
            <p>Let them not be permitted to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Gallants, or encourage Courtſhip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this is but uſed of late years, and very needleſs: That Allowance can only be tolerated in Palaces, where Dread and Reverence ſuppreſs Malice, which even there often breaks looſe and vio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lates the Immunity of the Place. Great care is to be had, what Kindred of both Sexes follow them; Coſins and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers-in-law, unleſs very well known, may ſpeak with them at a diſtance, and if they converſe not at all, it is ſo much the better. It is a Diſeaſe, to ſuffer Maids to go to their Siſters or Aunts to be cured: there is Danger, in permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them much to ramble Abroad, tho' with an Old Governant to overlook them. Too much Friendſhip among them is dangerous, much Whiſpering and Secrets are ſuſpitious: they are not to be ſuffered to call one another by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108575:38"/>
Nick-names of their own framing, as Husband, Granny, Goſſip, or my Love, my Dear, and the like; for this, tho' of it ſelf it be not bad, is in my opinion, only a Practice like playing with Foils, that they may become expert to do Miſchief.</p>
            <p>Yet would I not give the Advice to Maſters, that <hi>Machiavel</hi> does to Princes, <hi>That they ſow Diſcord among their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; that ſo every one being falſe to his Fellow, they may be all true to the Maſter.</hi> A Marryed Man muſt be vigilant, but muſt not expect to obtain Unity by evil means, that is only found (if any where) in a peaceable and well-governed Houſe. I do not pretend to immure, or wholly ſhut up theſe Women, nor refuſe them what is fit and decent; I only hint where the Danger lyes, that by the care of the Maſter, the Miſtreſs and Servants may eſcape it. Above all things, the Maſter muſt endeavour to be belov'd by the VVomen-Servants, and to this purpoſe is to treat them with all imaginable Kindneſs; and if he finds their Miſtreſs wrong them, he muſt appeaſe and rectify all. Let him not appear more zealous for any one in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108575:39"/>
particular, but carry an even hand with all. Liberality is of great force to attain this end, giving them ſometimes what they don t expect from him.</p>
            <p>As it is requiſite for the preſervation of our Health, that there be a harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Agreement between the Head and other Members of the Body, ſo there muſt be Concord and Unity between the Maſter of a Houſe and his Family, to live with Pleaſure and Satisfaction. VVomen are the moſt ſubject to raiſe Diſcontent, and cauſe a Diſturbance; therefore it is requiſite, to carry it very fair and even with them, leſt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcompoſed, infect and poiſon the Happineſs of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, as a Reward for the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I have expoſed my ſelf to, in diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with ſuch freedom, I deſire you will read and keep to your ſelf this advice: for altho' my preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeccures me from their Indignation, yet the memory of Paſt-Suffering makes me ſtill dread and ſtand in awe of them.</p>
            <p>Part of what I have ſaid in relation to the VVomen, may be applyed to the Men-Servants. The firſt Point I will touch concerning them, is, that no one
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108575:39"/>
of them be ſo diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, that it may afford any ground of Suſpition to the Miſtreſs. This often happens when Favour is indiſcreetly placed on any one; for VVomen are apt to ſuſpect thoſe Servants are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by their Maſters in ſcandalous Affairs; and they chiefly diſaffect thoſe that are of old ſtanding, as believing them the Managers of their Youthful Extravagancies: if this happen, let the Husband convince his VVife, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſhe ſhall be diſſatisfied, he cannot only exclude that Servant his Favour, but baniſh him his Houſe; and if requiſite, let him do it: for in this caſe, the ſupporting ſuch a Servant, is a confirmation of the VVives Jealouſy. I dare anſwer, a kind Woman that loves her Husband, will be ſatisfied to know it is in her power to be rid of that Eye-ſore, ſince the diſpoſal of it is left to her. Women are often like Colts, that go better when you give them their Head, and they think themſelves at liberty, than when they are Curbed, and under Reſtraint.</p>
            <p>Paſſion and Roughneſs is not a cure for Women; they are to be treated
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108575:40"/>
with Meekneſs and Civility. If any Artifice were allowable between Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried People, I ſhould think it a good Rule to make a Woman believe, ſhe cou'd do any thing with her Husband, and yet in reality, ſhe ſhould have no farther power over him, than to obtain things reaſonable. A VVoman of ſenſe is to know, ſhe is obliged to honour whom her Husband honours; and an honeſt Man, that he is to encourage none to diſreſpect his VVife.</p>
            <p>It cannot be deny'd a Maſter, to have more kindneſs for one or more Servants than for the reſt, according as each has merited by his Service. Take this as a general Rule in this caſe, that no body is ſurprized to ſee a Servant that has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved well, in Favour; but all the VVorld is miſtruſtful, when they ſee a known unworthy Servant preferred. This extends to Men of Quality, Noble-men and Princes.</p>
            <p>Tho' all Men ought to be cautious in chooſing Servants, yet Married-men particularly. Thoſe who value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on their Courage, are turbulent; ſuch as are Muſicians, are reſtleſs; thoſe that are Amorous, unfaithful; thoſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108575:40"/>
who ſet up for Beau's, impertinent. The beſt are Men well born and well-bred, and who have a ſenſe of Honour; theſe are their beſt Qualifications. Let the number be ſuitable to the Eſtate, as has been ſaid of the VVomen. The Houſe of a diſcreet Man muſt be always kept at a ſtand: yet this equality may be diſpenſed with upon ſome occaſions. Weddings, the Birth of Children, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, and publick Rejoycings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome increaſe of Family, which is needleſs to be continued when that time is paſt; and it would look ill to paſs-by ſuch times, without making ſome exterior Demonſtration; for the VVorld will not judge that Frugality to proceed from Prudence, but Avarice.</p>
            <p>I remember a Court-Paſſage to this purpoſe: I happened to be at Court when a King ſent an Embaſſy to the Emperor; the Perſon appointed was of great prudence; he added nothing to his former Retinue. The Miniſters looked upon this Frugality as a Crime: and becauſe the King had ordered this Affair whilſt he was Sick, ſome unlucky people ſaid, <hi>His Majeſty ſent that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador on his behalf in that nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108575:41"/>
he had vowed, if he recovered his Health, he would go barefoot to a certain place of Devotion in</hi> Germany.</p>
            <p>What is ſaid of the Number, may have ſome relation to the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Servants. Their Diet muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be plentiful; nothing ſo much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges People that aim not high, as good Feeding, which is a Satisfaction, or Miſery they go through twice a day: as to the Cloaths, they (as has been ſaid) may be better or worſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the time and occaſions that offer. But to be more plain in this caſe, I look upon it as the wiſer courſe, to Cloath and keep a Table for the Batchellors, then they are fed and clean: if they have Money, they play or ſpend it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhly, and then ſtarve. This is the danger of thoſe that are come to Years of Maturity; for thoſe that are young, hear what a Courtier of Quality uſed to ſay, <hi>That his Pages were never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Itch, till he brought them to lye with his Wifes old Governants.</hi> One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance more: A Prelate of a very ſtrict Religious Order told me, <hi>He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept his Fryers hungry, that they might ſtill be thinking how to feed better.</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:108575:41"/>
The contrary muſt be uſed with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for their Thoughts are not ſo bad when their Bellies are full.</p>
            <p>Having ſetled the Marryed man's Family and Retinue, let us ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Wife, and then will give further Directions in all other Affairs. My intention (as has been already ſaid) is not to give Advice how to chooſe a Wife; theſe Remarks are for one alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Marryed, and that has made a good Choice.</p>
            <p>It has been often asked, Whether it is convenient to make uſe of thoſe good Parts nature has endowed her with, as Singing, Dancing, compoſing Verſes, and other the like Accompliſhments to be found in ſome Women, and which more might have ſhare in, were they not modeſtly ſuppreſſed? This Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion asked of me, would put me to a ſtand, becauſe it looks like Malice and Impiety, to hide, and in a manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe Perfections God has beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on another; and yet it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to reſtrain the uſe of them, within the bounds of Prudence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs <hi>de la Roche Suryon</hi> in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108575:42"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> who was a moſt diſcreet Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and unhappy in a Husband, uſed to ſay to this purpoſe: <hi>That of the Three Faculties of the Soul, which ſhe had when ſhe Marryed, her Husband had taken Two, and left her but One, which ſhe would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly give him; for that She neither had Will nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and only retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Memory that She had once poſſeſſed them, which ſerved only the more to grieve her for the loſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be too well Accompliſhed in ſome Women, is a thing of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; becauſe it carries its own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, needs no Helps, and Prudence failing in the uſe of it; what ſeems a Bleſſing, turns to a Misfortune.</p>
            <p>It is very commendable for a Woman to Sing to her Husband and Children, and it may be permitted her to Dance, if very young, in her own Apartment: I cannot approve of carrying Caſtanets in her Pocket, learning wild Catches, and dancing Jiggs; theſe are all incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Lewdneſs. To Rally, and ſet up for a Wit in every Company, at Church, at Court, at the Play, is moſt pernicious, and hard to prevent; for no body repents of that which gains Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108575:42"/>
be the means good or bad. Let the Husband keep a watchful Eye; and if he reclaims her, it is a great Work: for as yet, I never ſaw any that was ſick of that Diſtemper, recover.</p>
            <p>
               <q>How diſagreeable will this Doctrine ſound to many of our Ladies, and yet how highly commendable it is? I have ſpoke, tho' little, more than will be grateful to many, in relation to their Wit, and will not therefore far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incur their Diſpleaſure on that account. One word as to Dancing and Singing: For the firſt, I believe all the Devils in Hell held a Council to invent it; for doubtleſs, never any thing turned more to their Account, or was more deſtructive to Human Kind. More Deſigns have been ſet a foot, more Intrigues carryed on, and more Women debauched by Dancing, than by all the other contrivances of Lewdneſs yet found out: the very invention of Balls had no other end, but compaſſing of Women, otherwiſe not to be attained; the Invention has been improved, and ſeems now to be at the height. Dancing-Schools are, and have always been accounted by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108575:43"/>
the wiſer ſort, no better than Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Vice, to inſnare young inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Women, and ſupport experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Sinners. In fine, Dancing is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned the grand Accompliſhment, and in reality, it is the grand Introduction to Lewdneſs; it is called an Ornament of Carriage, and is a depravation of Manners; it is eſteemed a Perfection, and is the moſt noted Rock for Ship-wrack'd Vertue. I am not inſenſible, I draw upon my ſelf the Indignation of the Beau's, not becauſe they believe this opinion falſe, but becauſe if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, it would cut them off the great Advantages they make by this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, towards debauching Young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: I incur the Diſpleaſure of thoſe Ladies, who think all things good and lawful, that are for Delight. But above all, the Dancing-Maſters Anger will (with moſt reaſon) be provoked, by expoſing what is their Maintenance. None of them need be offended; they will be no loſers by wholſom Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: for the World is too wicked ever to be reclaimed. Singing is a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Perfection, if a Woman has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to know, when to uſe and when
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108575:43"/>
to forbear it: it is always commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable for her, to divert her ſelf, to pleaſe her Husband, to be ſociable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Women; but to be heard to Sing in the company of Men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an expreſs Command of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, is not only vain, fooliſh, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, but ſavours much of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: A Wife that Sings to other Men beſides her Husband, deſires to be admired; if admired, ſhe would be beloved; and ſhe who deſires to be beloved, has no love for her Honour. The Husband, who delights to have his Wife Sing among other Men, takes a pleaſure ſhe ſhould be admired, and conſequently merits all the ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that are likely to follow. There are Times and Perſons exempt from the ſeverity of theſe Rules; a prudent Man well knows how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them, and what is ſaid to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Exceſs, muſt not be underſtood wholly to debar a modeſt and decent Liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We are now come to the confuſion of the Cuſtoms of the Court. I am in great fear, leaſt I ſhould begin not to know what I ſay, if that be not done already.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108575:44"/>
What limitation can be aſcribed to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Play, taking the Air, Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Goſſips and Friends? I wiſh I could ſee ſome Rule or Bounds to theſe things, whoever it were that aſſigned it.</p>
            <p>There are ſome things in themſelves indifferent, that are made good or bad only by cuſtom; others in themſelves bad, tho' never ſo much uſed, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be made good; and others that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bad, at length by cuſtom become tolerable. Sir, I wiſh you could gueſs at theſe things, without obliging me to to declare them; but I will do it by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obvious Examples. Faſhions in Cloaths, I look upon as things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; when Fardingals were wore, they were thought good and decent; ſince left off, they are become abſurd and ridiculous. I have a Book writ by <hi>Alonſo Caranca,</hi> againſt Men wearing their Hair long, and another compoſed by <hi>Pedro Mexia,</hi> which does not ceaſe exclaiming againſt its being wore ſhort. This is the effect of Cuſtom; for when the one of theſe lived, it was the Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to wear long Hair, and the ſhort was thought ſcandalous and unbecoming;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108575:44"/>
and in the time of the other, ſhort Hair was uſed, and to let it grow out, looked prepoſterous. Theſe are the things, which being in themſelves indifferent, are by cuſtom made good or bad.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> (we may add <hi>England,</hi>) it is an Act of Freedom, Friendſhip and good Nature, to drink till they loſe their Senſes. Here Cuſtom cannot juſtify, or make good what of it ſelf is a Vice, and naturally bad.</p>
            <p>Formerly any thing eaten above once a day, broke Faſt; Cuſtom has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced eating Collations, and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed good and lawful. This, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Practices, brought up only by cuſtom, became allowable, and are not accounted vicious.</p>
            <p>Behold here the power of Cuſtom! Let us allow Women their Faſhions, their Viſits, their Walks, and the like; things, tho' not good in themſelves, now authoriz'd by Cuſtom: but I muſt be bold to tell you, and all the World, That extravagant Play, diſorderly Feaſting, late Hours, too much haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Company, eſpecially ſuch as is not creditable, are the things which no Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108575:45"/>
can juſtify, or make tolerable. Where the Husband finds theſe Evils growing, let him put a ſtop to them in time, before they take Root; they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpring from Idleneſs, and vain Deſire: let him therefore remove Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by employing her in the care of the Family, and change the Deſire for another of more Honour and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as the deſire of living peaceably and contentedly with her Husband, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring Her, that cannot be whilſt She follows thoſe Courſes.</p>
            <p>A Perſon of great Quality ſpeaking in the behalf of a Servant in diſgrace, to his Prince, in my hearing, he ſaid, <hi>Let him continue in Diſgrace; for before I excluded him my Favour, I courted him to take me into the number of theſe Friends for whom he forſook me, and he would ever leave me to ſtick to his Friends.</hi> In the ſame nature, a Husband may court his Wife; and if he cannot prevail, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the ſame Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>It is a very hard Caſe, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of a Houſe ſhould love every thing but her Houſe, as appears by thoſe who are never in it, or when they are, it is only to help to ruine it. I ſaid, it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108575:45"/>
was convenient to employ the Wife in the Government of the Family; it is good and convenient, not only in order to keep her out of Idleneſs, but to eaſe the Husband of that Burden: thoſe trivial Affairs are not fit to employ a Man's Thoughts, and they are proper for a Woman. You would laugh to ſee an Elephant carry a grain of Wheat in his Trunk, and you admire to ſee a poor Ant drag it along: therefore our Proverb wiſely ſays, <hi>The Husband in the Market, the Wife at home.</hi> Thoſe Husbands who will pry into every thing, are as much to blame, as they who will look to nothing.</p>
            <p>In fine, it is convenient the Wife have the care of ordinary Houſhold Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to pleaſe, to employ, to let her ſee, ſhe is intruſted, to buſy her with thoſe Thoughts, and divert her from others: if ſhe does it well, what greater Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs! the Husband may reckon, he has found a Servant as good and as true as himſelf, who ſerves him for nothing: if ſhe does it not ſo well, the Evil is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. How much better is it, the Wife ſhould waſte ſomething, than a Servant? if ſhe does amiſs, 'tis againſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108575:46"/>
her will, or at leaſt with ſome Fear and Shame; and perhaps the Servant will do ill wilfully, and without any regret. The Houſes of the common ſort, are generally beſt managed, becauſe they follow this Rule; the one brings, the other ſaves.</p>
            <p>I am of opinion, Money ſhould be delivered by ſmall Parcels to a Woman, towards the daily Expence: not to keep them miſerably, but becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them (when they have much) ſpend profuſely. The Husband may let her know, he is but as it were, her Caſh-keeper, that ſhe may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to him, as freely as ſhe would to her Drawers; let him not only ſay ſo, but make it good by his Actions. He may praiſe her Management, and admire her Frugality. A good Taylor ſhews his Art in little Cloath, and a good Coachman in narrow Streets. I dare undertake, if the Woman affects Praiſe, the Expence will be leſs the next Month.</p>
            <p>To ſave the Diſguſt of calling her to an Account, let him tell her what he ſpends; and this confidence he puts in her, will oblige her to do the ſame.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108575:46"/>
Theſe Accounts between Married Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are never to be ſtrictly Ballanced; it is enough the Wife owns her ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable: the conſequence will be, that a VVoman never thinks her ſelf abſolute Miſtreſs of what ſhe poſſeſſes; She muſt ſpend with fear, and keep with fear, but never be deprived of what ſhe ſaves, and will then be as thankful for what is not taken from her, as what is given her.</p>
            <p>It is a Cuſtom now (eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the great ones) to ſettle the Wifes Allowance in the Articles of Marriage. I would adviſe thoſe that have promiſed, to perform it; and ſuch as have not, never to promiſe it. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying an Heireſs, breeds much incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency in this particular; for Heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes pretend to be Miſtreſſes of their own, and to have more Power over it than their Husbands: when a VVife pretends to this, ſhe muſt be informed, that he who is Maſter of her Perſon and Life, is ſo alſo of her Eſtate. Who is there that gives a Diamond Ring in a little Box, but gives the Box with it?</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Rigour our Author mentions, in truſting the VVife with Money, muſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108575:47"/>
be underſtood, where VVomen are not found capable of manging much, and are laviſh of it: For he is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a good and prudent Woman, who having ſuch a one, does not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt her with All, and make her as abſolute in the Diſpoſal of it, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But I have before touched this Point, and will only add, That a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and vertuous Wife ought to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs entirely the Heart, and the very Soul of her Husband, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot be debarred the command of his Fortune; all he can give, is ſtill leſs than ſhe deſerves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is needleſs to ſay much about her Cloathing; let her Cloaths be ſuitable to her Age, and change Apparel as ſhe riſes in Years: In this, particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard muſt be had to Children, Health, the Preſence or Abſence of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as alſo his Age. If any Rule can be aſcribed, I am of opinion, that till ſhe has bore three Children, or is Five and twenty years of Age, all Gaity may be allowed; but even within that time, it may riſe and fall: for the very Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of Churches are changed, and ſometimes they are put into Mourning.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:108575:47"/>
I abhor certain Gay Things always trimmed up, and ſet out with Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries, and Jewels that look like Queens of <hi>May,</hi> or Queens on a Stage. If a VVoman is Beautiful, let her have ſome confidence in her Beauty, without the continual addition of borrowed Charms; if ſhe is Ugly, let Modeſty reſtrain her.</p>
            <p>A witty Husband that had one of theſe Gaudy Wives, uſed to ſay, <hi>That when he ſaw her in that Dreſs, it rather ſtirred him up to Devotion than Love; becauſe ſhe ſeemed not to him as a Lady well cloathed, but as ſome religious Image adorned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others are made up of nothing but everlaſting Polvilloes, Sweet Pouder, Amber, and all manner of Perfume: Smells and they are much alike; Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Perfumes are all Smoak. Were theſe Sweets compounded with ſome grains of Diſcretion, there is no doubt they would be much more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. I confeſs, I always loved Neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Houſe and about the Perſon, but ſo, that what ſhould be Decency be not turned into Foppery. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I have read and heard of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108575:48"/>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II. Father to him now Reigning (if he can be ſaid to Reign,) <hi>That he would not lye in a certain Room, becauſe it was Perfumed:</hi> If it was an Antipathy, the thing was excuſable; if only Fancy, it was very impertinent. Some are of opinion, it proceeded from Zeal; for that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> believed, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes were only due to God. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſaid of our King <hi>Sebaſtian, That he was not at all fond of Perfumes:</hi> I know not how this comes to paſs, for having always heard, Things that are Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, called Royal, are fit for a King. I thought all good Things were Royal, that is, grateful and acceptable to Kings; but Experience teaches us, this Rule is not infallible; yet it is a certain ſign of a good Inclination, to affect all things that are good. I know not whether ſo much Logick be applicable to Womens Perfumes; let it ſuffice, if the uſe of them is no Vertue, that at leaſt it is no Vice.</p>
            <p>As to Sweet-meats and Preſerves; theſe things being uſeful for weak Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, for the Sick, and for Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ought to be allowed, yet ſo, that the Expence made in them be not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108575:48"/>
wanting for more neceſſary uſes. It is very convenient VVomen be allowed to pleaſe themſelves with Curioſities of their own making, that they take Pride in the VVorks of their Hands; for being taken up with thoſe Houſhold Affairs, their Thoughts are well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and it is commendable.</p>
            <p>The Furniture and Ornaments of the Houſe, may be alſo included under this Head; it being an excellent Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a VVoman, to buſy her ſelf about them, and commendable in the Husband to encourage her. Theſe things are ſerviceable, diverting, credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and are a Treaſure for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and very often there is more got by them, than by ſending Ventures to <hi>India;</hi> for there is no old rich Tapiſtry or <hi>Turky</hi> Carpet, but is of great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to make the VVorld believe, there are Portions in that Houſe of many Thouſands of Crowns.</p>
            <p>Receiving and paying of Viſits, is a tireſom Encumbrance. I have before touched this Point, but not to content; much might be ſaid, but all is not fit to be committed to Writing. I cannot forbear telling, what a Man of ſence
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108575:49"/>
(who had none of the beſt Wives) ſaid to me; after making many Complaints againſt his Wife, he concluded with theſe words; <hi>Yet after all, what moſt troubles me, is, that She is ſo well beloved.</hi> And in truth, too many Friends are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry troubleſom; for all Friends are not ſuch as they ought to be. What for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was uſual, as giving a Glaſs of Wine, became a Collation, from a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it roſe to a Feaſt, and now I know not what Name to give it. I cannot underſtand what Friendſhip there is in ruining one another, deſtroying their Families with needleſs Expences, and tormenting their Husbands with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual begging what cannot and ought not to be granted: if this Profuſeneſs tends to expreſs Love, that Friendſhip is baſe which is grounded on Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; if to ſhew Grandeur, that is a needleſs demonſtration among Friends.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman fell Sick with Grief and Concern, to ſee himſelf loaded with Debts, through the Exceſs of his Wives Seedleſs Expences; he being in a high Fever, and ſeeing a Diſh of Preſerved Citrons which his VVife uſed to treat with, tho' very dear; the poor Sick Man
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:108575:49"/>
ſaid, <hi>Give me that Citron, for I will eat it all.</hi> His VVife begged he would not eat it, <hi>becauſe Citron adds Fire to a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi> and he anſwered, <hi>I know it is the Fire that conſumes me; but I would try whether Citron have the ſame property as a mad Dog, whoſe Hair applyed to the Sore made by his Teeth, is a certain Cure.</hi> One of his Servants was no leſs witty; for being asked by a Gentleman, <hi>Whether he might ſee his Maſter?</hi> He Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>My Maſter is not in a condition to be ſeen, for my Miſtreſs and her Company are eating him for a Collation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the Husband now and then, give his VVife ſome wholſom Advice; warn her, neither at home nor abroad, ever to jeſt upon, or nick-name any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; Women ſo nick-named, if the ſence be good, are proud of it; if bad, will make a return; and Men will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, or ſeek to return Thanks. That ſhe make no Reflections on the Actions of others, Whether ſuch a Man has a Kindneſs, or Courts ſuch a Lady! it looks ill in a Lady, (who ought only to think of her ſelf and Family,) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern her ſelf with the Thoughts of others. That ſhe neither much praiſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108575:50"/>
nor diſcommend any Man. This ſo different effect generally in Women, ſprings from the ſame Cauſe. I always drew the ſame concluſion from <hi>Womens</hi> ſpeaking very ill, or very well of any Man; and the worſt is, I was never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. VVomens Diſcourſe ought to be about their Work, the Seaſon of the VVeather, Complaints of their Maids; and I will allow them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their Husbands Unkindneſs, even tho' it be falſe. Becauſe theſe are narrow Limits, they may be permitted to praiſe or condemn the Faſhion of of their Cloaths, to like or diſlike the Fancy, ſo they do not extend to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting of Colours.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This in part, is too ſevere a Reſtraint to be put upon our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies, and even not fair or honourable, in one Point. The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Women being confined, and bred in Ignorance, may ſuit with it; but ours, uſed to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Freedom, and brought up to more Underſtanding, ought not to be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the uſe of that Judgment their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation has given them. Their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe muſt be free with Modeſty and Reſpect to decency, no Reflections on
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108575:50"/>
any body, no prying into others Lives, no cenſuring of Actions, no extolling of particular Men, no railing at their own Sex, not too much of Learning, not over much Godlineſs; all theſe things are equally Scandalous and Dangerous. The World is wide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to ſupply them with Matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive, and all that a Woman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands, and is not againſt Modeſty and good Manners, may as juſtly be the Subject of her Entertainment, as of the moſt Learned Man. That Point allowed by our Author, which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as not honourable, is the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he gives a Wife to complain of her Husband's Unkindneſs, even tho' ſhe accuſe him wrongfully. A Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Wifes Complaints, tho' never ſo juſt, ought never to be heard but by her Husband; to him alone ſhe ought to make known her Grievances, with Affection and Submiſſion, and from him alone expect Redreſs. A Father is not (if poſſible) to hear ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, much leſs to have them made the Town-talk, by putting them into the mouth of every impertinent Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant: But above all, if thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108575:51"/>
be unjuſt, how much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable is the VVife, that expoſes the good Name of her Husband, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Fault committed on his ſide? Any Diſcourſe is more pardonable, than that which is deſtructive of the Reputation of our Neighbour; how much worſe then muſt it be, that ſtrikes at the Credit of a Husband?</q>
            </p>
            <p>I come once more to Female Friends, and cannot but obſerve, That the name of Friends and Enemies in <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> differs but in one Letter; the one being called <hi>Amigas,</hi> the other <hi>Imigas:</hi> I am ſo wicked to believe, VVomens Friends have done them more harm than their Enemies. Therefore I commonly ſay, Men are ruined by their Enemies, and VVomen by their Friends.</p>
            <p>It is proper, reaſonable and good, to go to Court, but it muſt be very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as upon the Birth of Princes, Marriages, Feſtivals, Sickneſs of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their Recovery, upon occaſion of Happy News, and the like, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. It is not ſo becoming to go alone; let the Company be always good, but not of Perſons of greater Quality, (unleſs the firſt time,) for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108575:51"/>
their Authority takes off from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception every one expects to find in Courts, and all other places: it often happens VVomen take upon them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be in favour with Queens and Princeſſes; this produces much Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and no Profit: and ſometimes they make uſe of this pretence, to cloak all their looſe Actions, (as ſome Servants who ſtop their Maſters mouths, when they have been idling abroad) by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>They have been at Church.</hi> Thus, often good things are made a cloak for the bad. Upon pretence of going to Courr, VVomen grow idle, and the care of the Family is neglected. It is enough for a VVoman of Quality, that the Queen knows her; ſhe will value her the more, for carrying her ſelf with Diſcretion thoſe few times ſhe ſees her: An Expreſs raiſes the Expectation of all Men; no body takes notice of the common Poſt. It is dangerous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive, for thoſe who are not imployed in the Service of Princes, to aim at their Favour. A Courtier compared the Court that is to be made to Ladies and to Kings, to the uſe of a <hi>Lemon and Orange;</hi> the <hi>Lemon</hi> muſt be ſqueezed
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108575:52"/>
hard, and it yields the better Juice; the other is to be ſqueezed but lightly, or elſe it is bitter. Ladies require much Attendance; Kings need only now and then be ſeen: therefore one wiſely ſaid, <hi>That Princes and Fire were beſt at a diſtance, becauſe, near they Burn, and at a diſtance give Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Too much preciſeneſs in frequenting the Church, is meerly Formality: there is no doubt, it is good and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to go to Church at the uſual times, and on proper days; but all things that are good, are not convenient at all times. Let the VVife have reaſon to believe, ſhe may go always; but let Kindneſs and Courteſy prevail with her, to forbear ſometimes.</p>
            <p>A Married Man being asked, <hi>Where his Wife went to Church?</hi> anſwered, <hi>Whereſoever there is Muſick.</hi> In <hi>Spain,</hi> I knew an antient Lady of Quality, VVitty and very Vertuous, who when ſhe got into her Coach, and the Coach-man asked, <hi>Whither he muſt go?</hi> uſed to Anſwer, <hi>Where there is moſt People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I will not make too bold in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, for fear I be judged Prophane, as obſtructing Devotion; but that is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108575:52"/>
not my deſign, only the abuſe of it is here meant. That haunting of Churches uſed in <hi>Portugal</hi> on Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, tho' in another nature, is not ill imitated in <hi>England.</hi> Six of the Clock Morning Prayers and Evening Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (in Winter) are the Delight of ſome Ladies; they had rather go a mile on Sunday, to <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> Church or <hi>White-Hall</hi> Chappel, than to their Pariſh, tho' their Houſe join to it: this is a deſire to be ſeen by Men, not by God; his Preſence is equally in every Church, but the Company is not the ſame. The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of ſuch a Wife has cauſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Whether of them it is that draws her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Well, ſince I have deſcended to ſo many particulars, I will venture a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle farther, it will divert ſo much ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reflection. I cannot approve of Trimmed Lap-dogs, that have myſtical Names: Being in a Church, a Page came running out of Breath, to ask me, <hi>If I had ſeen ſuch a Ladies Delight, that was loſt?</hi> And, having asked what the Ladies Delight was, found it was a little Dog of that Name. Parrots and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108575:53"/>
and Monkies are needleſs Troubles, and often inſpire ill Thoughts. Miners by the Graſs, and Flowers that grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, know whether there be a Gold-Mine or not: Exterior Signs diſcover what is within. I begin to be ſo impertinent, I ſhall not leave a Bird. What is the uſe of Singing Birds, that in Summer begin to whiſtle with the Day, and are ſaid to divert the Thoughts in the Morning? What bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Employment for a Womans Thought, than the Husband that lyes by her ſide. Little diverting Blacks, witty Foundlings, ſilly Country-Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows (who ſometimes are not ſo ſilly as they appear) cloathed in ſeveral Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, who have liberty to go where they pleaſe, are not fit, nor would I have them be ſeen in a Houſe: all theſe things in my opinion, are Prejudicial, and I ſhould be glad they were removed from the Houſes of all my Friends. I proteſt, I ever loathed the Ladies in Romances, becauſe I always found Lap-dogs, Lions and Dwarfs, about them: ſo great is my Averſion from that ſort of Vermin, that I cannot bear with them in Fabulous Books; think how I ſhall
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108575:53"/>
like them when real. But it is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon my particular Fancy ſhould make a general Rule, let this paſs as a caution to any Man, that is of the ſame depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved humour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> highly commend good Houſwives, who love home and mind the Affairs of their Family; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol them ſo much becauſe they are ſcarce, and it is hard to find ſuch a Woman among them. However it is ſaid of Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> Mother to <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth, that ſhe and her Ladies Embroider'd, and Sold their Work, the Profit whereof was given to Nuns. So did the late Queen of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and her Aunt Queen <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> who Enriched Monaſteries with their Work, many pieces whereof are yet to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margaret de Valois,</hi> who was Queen of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navar,</hi> whoſe Writings I admire, and whom I look upon as the Wiſeſt Woman of this Age, does not ceaſe to expreſs how much ſhe was pleaſed to ſee the Counteſs <hi>de Lalain,</hi> being at Table with the Queeen, open her Boſom to give the Breaſt to a Child ſhe Suckled her ſelf. The Queen high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108575:54"/>
extols that deed of the Counteſs, and ſays, ſhe never envyed any Action in Woman, but that.</p>
            <p>There are certain Women like Idols, who are good for nothing, or are proud to be thought ſo, think they were Born only to be Worſhipped, and will ſerve for no other uſe. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they ſhould have but one Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Houſes, and that is, that a Woman be Miſtreſs of her Houſe, and perform the Duty of that Office, and if ſhe does it well, ſhe has diſcharged her Duty to her Husband and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>How will it be taken, if I ſhould find fault with the Manly <hi>Amazonian</hi> Ladies? Were I ſure the Courage of Women would be rightly apply'd, I could bear with it; but that being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dubious, it is better they ſhould ſhake at the ſight of a naked Sword, and fall into a Swoon at Thunder; God ordained they ſhould be timorous, it is beſt they ſhould be ſo. It is happy if they do what they are oblig'd to, let none require more of them.</p>
            <p>Well, I am ſure I ſhall diſoblige them all, I am loath to ſay any thing of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108575:54"/>
their Judgment, or preſcribe Rules to that by which all other things are to be Govern'd; but ſince I preſum'd to give Laws to Love, which is a more abſolute Power, I will not be afraid to give ſome to the Underſtanding; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but admire at a Saying of that ſo much quoted Biſhop of ours <hi>D. Affonſo,</hi> which was, <hi>The moſt knowing Woman, only knows how to lay up a Cheſt of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen.</hi> Nor can I forget Another who ſaid, <hi>The moſt knowing Woman, knows as much as two Women.</hi> I am of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Opinion, I have ſeen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with ſome in <hi>Spain</hi> and other Parts: Therefore I think it neceſſary to allay and temper with Diſcretion, that quickneſs of Apprehenſion, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Wit wherein they ſurpaſs us. No bounds can be aſſign'd to their Wit, but to the uſe of it, there may: As if a Razor of excellent Metal were given a Man, to do ſome Bloody deed, but the Razor not yet finiſhed, or grownd to an Edge; he who kept him from a Stone to grind it upon, would do as much good as if he took the Razor from him. So it is not in our power, to deprive Women of the pure Metal of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108575:55"/>
their Underſtanding, which Nature has beſtow'd on them, but we may take from them the Opportunity of ſharpning it to their own danger, and our harm. Let us do the beſt we can. Let not Women meddle or concern themſelves with the Affairs and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men, becauſe they have Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as well as we, and ſaying as ſome do, that the Soul is neither Male nor Female. Yet let the Husband know that this does not exclude a diſcreet Wife from offering her Sentiments modeſtly, nor free him from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of asking her Opinion.</p>
            <p>Do not think I recant or contradict what I have ſaid before, you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it by this compariſon. Let the Wife be the Hand, and the Husband the Clock, ſhe point, and he ſtrike. The one ſhows, the other guides; a Clock thus regular is believed by all, and paſſes for an Oracle. It is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular only it ſelf, but keeps others in good order. But if once it errs, it miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leads every Body.</p>
            <p>How it pleaſes me to ſee a Woman Ignorant of thoſe things, ſhe ought not to know; or at leaſt appear ſo,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108575:55"/>
though inreality ſhe does know them. I look upon it as a great Perfection when they err in thoſe Affairs, which might bring a Reflection upon them, if rightly managed. Let a Woman Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what is proper for Women, let her Read and Diſcourſe of ſuch things; and let none but ſuch be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her to Read or Diſcourſe of.</p>
            <p>Since my Hand is in, I will go on with my Proverbs. Travelling one day, I heard a grave Carrier (obſerve, I have ſlighted the Philoſophers, to quote theſe Authors) but him I heard ſay, <hi>God deliver me from a Mule that Brays, and a Woman that Speaks Latin.</hi> The pleaſure I receiv'd in hearing this witty Sentence, makes me now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it; let us not look upon it as contemptible, if profitable: The caſe is, that <hi>Latin</hi> of it ſelf does no harm, but the other little Sparks of Learning that attend it, are of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
            <p>Since (as at firſt I tould you) I am ſitting by the Fire, and you hear, I will venture to tell you another Story. An ancient ſober Woman went to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to an Old ſurly Fryer; ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108575:56"/>
to ſay the <hi>Confiteor</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> the Confeſſor asked her, <hi>Do you Speak Latin,</hi> ſhe reply'd, <hi>Father I was Bred in a Monaſtery:</hi> Then ſaid the Fryer, <hi>Are you Marry'd, Maid or Widow,</hi> ſhe Anſwer'd, <hi>A Marry'd Woman? Where is your Husband,</hi> ſays the Fryer: <hi>In India,</hi> ſays ſhe. Then the Old Man wittily reply'd; <hi>Hold then Child, you underſtand</hi> Latin, <hi>were Bred in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and your Husband is in</hi> India: <hi>Then go about your Buſineſs, and come ſome other day, for it is certain you have much to ſay, and I am in haſte at preſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not have Women be too knowing in matters of War and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, nor aim at it. I abhor ſome that will talk of Government, judge of Diſcourſe, decide points of Honour, and raiſe Diſputes. Others that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Skill in Poetry, have a Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of ſtrange Languages, define Love and its Effects, Study hard Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to puzzle the Learned, and talk of unknown places. Others that know all the ſecret Virtues of Herbs, that tell the ſignification of colours, that cenſure Sermons, that pick diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Sentences out of them, that uſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108575:56"/>
cramp Words, that ſpeak by Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors, that have unuſual ways of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and that keep time to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the motions of Hands and Eyes. Away with all this, it looks Counterfeit, and is not tolerable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feigned or real. Do not think me cenſorious, I had rather you ſhould believe me impertinent. But I aſſure you all I have hinted, is worth obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
            <p>A Lady deſired her Brother who was a Man of Sence, to give her ſome Motto for a Device ſhe deſign'd to have engrav'd on a Seal, he anſwer'd, <hi>Siſter, Leave Divices for the Shields of Knights Errant, and do you deviſe how to make a Tart for your Husband, when you have one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Not unlike to this, was the Saying of our late Sovereign, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. A Perſon of much Note for his Writings, tho' of very little for his Learning, telling the King he had Marry'd a Wife that underſtood <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> His Majeſty ask'd, <hi>Can ſhe make a Pudding?</hi> And then added, <hi>That is Learning enough for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108575:57"/>
your Wife, it is you ought to underſtand the Languages.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To Talk always is bad, to Talk loud is worſe, and to Talk in impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per places worſt of all. Some Women value themſelves upon anſwering loud at Church, and will converſe with their Acquaintance that are at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, on purpoſe to be heard. To ſigh at Sermon, to make motions with the Head in token of Approbation, to Pray aloud, to beat time to the Muſick, are Actions no way allowable. A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Woman muſt ſpeak as much as is requiſite, in reaſon, with a low Voice, ſo that the Perſon ſhe directs her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to may hear, and not thoſe who are not concern'd. A Judicious Perſon compar'd People to Bells, the Ringing diſcovers whether they are ſound, or crackt. I will not go about to ſhow how words diſcover the Soul; but in ſhort, as we know by the Poſt that comes from any place what has happened there, ſo by the words we diſcover how Affairs ſtand, with the Brain whence they proceed.</p>
            <p>The Women, I know will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me with an ill Eye, ſince I pretend
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108575:57"/>
to regulate their very Motions. One of the moſt unſufferable things in them, is the uſe of unbecoming Actions. I know they have not all the ſame natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Air and Grace, but they may all carry themſelves with Gravity and Staidneſs. There is a damn'd Word much in faſhion, that is Airineſs, and in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Airineſs is Impudence. I was about ſaying more, but let this ſuffice. It is a plain caſe that Airineſs is bad, becauſe Gravity and Staidneſs is good. No Toleration of this kind is to be given a VVoman; it being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely as becoming for a VVoman to preſerve a Decorum in theſe exterior Actions, as for a ſtately Building to have a Noble Front to ſet it off.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay of Laughter? If a Woman has white Teeth, a pretty Mouth, and Dimples in her Cheeks, therein lies the greateſt danger. Some of theſe ſort of Creatures will Laugh all the while at a Funeral Sermon, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expoſe their Treaſure. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly true, that much Laughter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens folly. Far be it from me, that I ſhould perſwade a VVoman to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Melancholy, this only ſerves to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108575:58"/>
ſhew her Life is uneaſy. Let her be merry, and laugh at home at her Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with her Husband, Children and Friends; when ſhe goes abroad, let her leave her Laughter at home, as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that caſts up its Venom before it drinks, and after drinking ſwallows it again: When ſhe comes home, let her reſume her Mirth.</p>
            <p>I have yet ſome ſcruple of Conſcience about their Reading: the beſt Book for them is their Needle, and their Work; yet would I not wholly debar them Reading: I do not like them that will always be reading Plays, that learn Parts, and love to repeat them. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are mad for Novels, and ſome for Plays. The affection to theſe things, is more dangerous than the uſe of them. I do not deny, but this Diverſion may be allowed them, but leaſt to thoſe who are moſt fond of it; for they ſeem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to affect the Parity of Thought, than the Novelty of Story: I would have no body delight in any thing, but what is lawfully pleaſing.</p>
            <p>I will tell you a Paſſage I can never forget: travelling in <hi>Spain,</hi> I came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Lodging cold, and covered with
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108575:58"/>
Snow, and could never prevail with the Landlady, or either of her two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to ſhew me a Room; the more I preſſed, the more they aſſured me, none of them would ſtir till they heard out a Novel that was very pleaſing to them. They valued not that I threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to go to another Inn, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me to ſit with them, and hear the pretty Courtſhip that was between <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouret</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> for that was the ſubject of the Novel. In fine, I went to another Inn, and coming back that way ſoon after, I enquired after the Mother and two Daughters, that were ſo taken up with the Novel, and was told, That within a few days, each of the Young ones had furniſhed Matter for another Novel, having run away from the Town with two young Fellows, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving themſelves good Scholars of their ſo much admired Learning.</p>
            <p>Well, we are come to Sanctimony, or rather Bigotry. I have tired you, and would fain run over this matter, but fear I cannot: It is a matter of greateſt moment; ſtrive, tho' it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the grain, to give attention, and I will endeavour to ſpeak with much circumſpection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:108575:59"/>VVe have ſeen many Perſons of Note, and well inclined, under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence of Vertue, led away to a diſorderly courſe of Life. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſometimes deals with us, as a Man that looks for another, who if he ſees him coming towards him, ſtays there till he comes; but if he ſees him go an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way, then he puts on faſter, till he over-takes him. The Devil for the moſt part, does not go on to meet ill Livers, becauſe he knows they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards him; but it is, after them who live well, that he drives on with all poſſible ſpeed.</p>
            <p>Reformation of Manners is a good and holy thing; but it has certain li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, in reſpect to Married VVomen: they muſt not apply themſelves to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exerciſes, ſo as to neglect the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Family; God has ſo ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, that every one may be ſaved, by performing what is incumbent on them with reſpect to their condition. There are a ſort of Men and VVomen in the VVorld, who profeſs themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Vertue, whereas in reality they are not ſo much as Learners. Theſe often wind themſelves into
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108575:59"/>
eſteem of Pious Ladies, and Perſons of Quality, without any conſideration, and guide them as blindly as they do themſelves, and as Experience has ſhewn us by diſmal Examples.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The different Cuſtoms of Countries, and even the difference of Religion, are the Cauſe our Author here has made ſome Reflection, and given ſuch Counſels, as are not at all ſuitable to us; they will not be well underſtood by ſuch as have not been abroad, and tho' they were, yet will they prove of no uſe here: I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought good to omit them, and ſubſtitute ſome parallel Obſervations more agreeable to the conſtitution of the Religious Bigotry in practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. It is a commendable and ever approved cuſtom of Ladies that aſpire to Perfection in Vertue, to give themſelves up to the direction of ſome Spiritual Guide: This I ſay, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, when a VVoman caſts her ſelf upon ſuch a Director, as by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral approbation is allowed of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Learning and tryed Vertue. But, how rare are thoſe to be found? There is nothing ſo pernicious, as when
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108575:60"/>
a VVoman led by a blind Zeal, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the care of her Soul to thoſe Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical Hypocrites, whoſe Godlineſs only conſiſts in violent Railing, in rowling their Eyes, in the motions of their Heads and Hands, and to be plain, in diligently concealing their dear Enormities, ſo much practiſed by themſelves, and ſo much inveighed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt in others. I will not ſpeak of thoſe Ladies, who like theſe blind Guides, and with their aſſiſtance make Sanctity the Cloak to cover their Lewdneſs. There are few Men who know any thing of Intrigue (and there are very few that do not) but are themſelves Judges, how frequent that Practice is. It is not theſe ſort of Creatures we have in hand; theſe are paſt Cure: there is no hope of reclaiming them; Intereſt is their God, Pleaſure their Paradiſe; they are the moſt obſtinate ſort of Pagans; for poſſeſſing at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their Deity and their Reward, they will never be perſwaded to leave them, for a God and a Heaven to be poſſeſſed hereafter. VVhen a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band perceives his VVife, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are Vertuous, and who
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108575:60"/>
aims at true Piety, fall ignorantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of one of thoſe Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and ſuffer her ſelf to be led by him; it is then high time to look about him. The leaſt Delays are of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence, an immediate Cure muſt be applied; he muſt cut off that Converſation, before it take Root; ſhe muſt be held back, before ſhe is quite loſt. Where the Devil finds a hot, but indiſcreet Zeal, he blows it into a Flame, till it conſume it ſelf. The Bellows he makes uſe of, are thoſe Canting falſe Prophets, who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Word of God, have no other Sound but the Voice of Hell. Theſe are the Idols ſome VVomen adore, to them they make their Offerings; and, if not prevented, to them they fall down; them (at firſt) they make the Keepers of their Wealth, and (at laſt) of their Honour. Theſe are the Thieves who rob Families inſenſibly, of their Wealth; the Enemies, who ſow the Tares of Sedition between Married People, while they ſleep, and the falſe Lights that miſguide frail Vertue, till it tumbles headlong into the Precipice of Vice. As theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108575:61"/>
are to be excluded the Houſe, ſo muſt a Woman wholly be debarred frequenting their Sermons, hearing their Doctrine, or being ſeen in their Congregations: It is enough, ſhe be allowed her Pariſh, or thoſe Churches where moſt Decency is obſerved; that ſhe frequent them on the proper Days, at moſt ſeaſonable Hours; that ſhe go with modeſt Company; that at other times, ſhe pray in her Cloſet: Let her not go thro' the Church, as if ſhe were at a Play; not go to ſee, and endeavour to be ſeen; not take much Greatneſs upon her, ſince in the ſight of God, the meaneſt is as acceptable as the greateſt; not Pray aloud; not crowd to be the firſt out, nor ſtay the laſt. Some Men indiſcreetly fly from one Extream into another; becauſe there is danger in Hypocriſy, they hate all that looks like Devotion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are Phariſees, they can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no Church-men. If one enters the Houſe, ſome leave them with their Wives, pretend Buſineſs, and fly their Company: others indeed, will ſtay, but grow uneaſy, afford not a pleaſing Look, nor obliging Word. Honour
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108575:61"/>
ſhould oblige them to ſtay, good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be civil. Church-men are to be treated with reſpect; it is better not admit, then once admitted, not to ſhew them a good Countenance. To ſpeak the truth, I am much of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of one that uſed to ſay, He had a great reſpect for Church-men; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if they were bad, he would not encourage them to be worſe; and if good, would not give them an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of being bad in his Houſe. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other more nicely ſaid, They were only good in four places, at the Altar, in the Pulpit, and in the Confeſſion-Seat; and being asked a fourth, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, a Picture.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A Wife ought always to be Dreſſed neat and decently, in the Houſe; her Servants ſhould never ſee her in any unbecoming Garb. As ſhe is obliged to endeavour to pleaſe none in the World but her Husband, ſo ſhe ſhould always appear to him, as if all the World ſaw her.</p>
            <p>
               <q>There is no neceſſity, a VVoman ſhould always be ſet out in the Houſe, in all the Formalities of a ſtrict Dreſs; conveniency and eaſe, has found out
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108575:62"/>
what is called Undreſſes, as Decent, as Becoming, and as Modeſt. Some are no ſooner Married, but they grow careleſs, either through Affectation, or natural Lazineſs: They all uſe the ſame Plea, to wit, That they are Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. The ſame Arts they uſed to gain a Husband, the ſame they ought to uſe, to preſerve him. Yet VVomen would all appear like Angels abroad, and value not (many of them) how like Devils they look at home. They will be ſeen Gay and Glorious by thoſe they pretend, not to regard, and be always Diſcompoſed and Loathſom in the Eyes of him they ought alone to oblige. Nor does it end here; they will receive Viſits, and expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that unſeemly manner to the Eyes of their Friends, or thoſe who only pretend to be ſo. This is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Perſon received, and a great leſſening of her that receives the Viſit. To appear in a diſagreeable Garb to the Husband, breeds Diſtaſte; to be ſeen ſo by Strangers, produces Contempt. To this purpoſe, a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier being invited by a Friend, and ill treated, ingeniouſly ſaid to him, <hi>I
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108575:62"/>
thought we had not been ſuch intimate Friends.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Some Men there are, who proud of their Wives Ablilities, or Beauty, make them the common Subject of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and take all opportunities to ſhew Them, and their Perfections. This looks as if they expoſed them to Sale, and is expoſing their Vertue to be tryed; for the more Beautiful, the more Charming a Woman is, the more others (as well as the Husband) will affect her; and the more he makes her Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, the leſs worthy of her, will ſhe and they believe him. I do not pretend, he ſhould not be free and eaſy with his Friends, that he ſhould not Entertain them in his own, and be Entertained in their Houſes, that he ſhould hide his Wife, and be afraid of every body that ſees her: either Exceſs is equally bad; his Houſe muſt neither be a Goal to her, nor a Publick Place of Entertainment for all the World; it is fit, ſhe grace his Table, when he invites his Friends and familiar Acquaintance, not that ſhe be made the Diſcourſe of his wild and extravagant Companions. It is the Duty of the Wife, to ſee all things be in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108575:63"/>
good order, that nothing be wanting; to be pleaſed and eaſy with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Gueſts, and to know (without being bid) to withdraw, if requiſite, and when to ſtay, if convenient. Her Behaviour will produce reſpect, if good; and all that ſee it, will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her as we do upon things Holy at a diſtance, without preſuming to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
            <p>I cannot forbear ſpeaking one word of a certain ſort of Matrons, who right or wrong, will wear the Breeches, and be abſolute within doors: theſe ground their Pretenſions to that uſurped Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, on being very Vertuous, very Wiſe, or of very great Birth; and ſometimes, when the Husbands are Mild, good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd, or Looſe Livers, they compaſs it without alledging any of thoſe Titles. If once the Husband diſcovers any ſuch Deſign in his Wife, let him look nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to her; for, if once ſhe gets the upper hand of him, ſhe will never give over till he entirely becomes her Slave. I knew one, who finding his Wife upon theſe Terms, ſaid to her, <hi>Madam, I will carry you home to your Father, and then will take a courſe at Law with him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108575:63"/>
my Wife:</hi> and ſhe asking of him, <hi>Why he ſaid ſo?</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Becauſe you are not my Wife, but my Husband.</hi> An ingenious and pleaſant Married-man, uſed to tell me, It was impoſſible but Women would command their Husbands; but that all a good Man could do, was to endeavour, it ſhould be as late as poſſible. For my part, I can no way allow, it ſhould ever come to paſs; no Man of ſence, will allow of it; and no Woman that loves her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, deſires it.</p>
            <p>I have not yet ſpoke of the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Houſhold Affairs, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much circumſpection. The Houſe it ſelf, I would have compact; I do not approve of wild Rambling Buildings, full of Doors, By Stairs, and private Paſſages. The Palaces of Kings and Princes, are ſurrounded with Guards and Porters, which prevent all Inconveniences might happen, like Spikes ſet upon a low VVall. The Houſes of Men of Quality, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo well ſecured, require ſome old and truſty Servants, whom their Maſter ſhould appoint, to be watchful and vigilant Overſeers, of the good
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:108575:64"/>
Order and Decency obſerved in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. But the Husband is not wholly to rely upon them; for as in War, we think it not enough to poſt Centinels, unleſs we keep continual Rounds upon them, to keep them Waking, and ſee they perform their Duty; ſo the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a Family, muſt perpetually have an Eye over thoſe whom he has entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the care of his Reputation.</p>
            <p>I would have no Black or Tawny Women that go on Errands; they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally prove Fruitful, and in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, every ſlip of Theirs is a Scandal to the Houſe; for it is a ſhame, ſuch infamous Practices ſhould be allowed, in the face of a Lady and her Maids. Little Black and <hi>Mullatto</hi> Boys, are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils incarnate, naturally Buffoons, and of a miſchievous Wit; they are pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered by the Maids; and for Apples and Pears, manage their Intrigues. Gipſies, Sanctify'd Women, ſuch as carry about Small-wares, and ſome that ſell things for leſs than they are worth, are all pernicious Cattel. Dumb Women are Vipers Landreſſes, women that carry Noſegays; others, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Buy or Sell, grow familiar with the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108575:64"/>
Maids, and perſwade them, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without them; as alſo Fortune-tellers and Mountebanks, are not fit to be converſed with. Jeſters, eſpecially thoſe who belong to Princes, grow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent upon the leaſt incouragement. Men that practice Slight of Hand, thoſe who mimick Sermons, imitate Beaſts, and act other Men, are a deſtructive Generation: but above all, thoſe VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are ſo who ſell VVaſhes for the Face, take away Freckles, make falſe Eye-brows, and ſmooth the Skin; thoſe who go about Begging for others, and Pedlars. All this ſort of People, that uſually reſort to great Houſes, ſtick like Fiſh to the Rocks; they are hard to remove, but worſe to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. There muſt be Force uſed as well Induſtry, to expel them; for all this ſort of Vermin only ſtudies how to Cheat, to Get, to Steal, to Lie, to tell News, and very often to bring and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry very ſcandalous Meſſages, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the Diſcredit of thoſe Houſes that entertain them; from which, God deliver all good People.</p>
            <p>A Man of conſiderable Quality had a ſick Daughter, whom he kept very
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108575:65"/>
ſtrictly: She had a Gallant, who uſed to write to her; the Letter was rowled up, and a Noſegay made upon it. A Hypocrite, under the habit of a Hermit, uſed to talk to her Father, and preſent him with the Noſegay, as brought from the Altar of ſome Saint: He was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and carried it to his Daughter, and under thoſe Flowers, adminiſtred the Poyſon he ought to keep from her, and might be ſaid, to play the part of her Procurer. VVho would have thought, ſuch Villany could lye hid under ſuch fair Appearances, as Sanctity and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers! This made good the words of the Poet, <hi>Latet Anguis in Herba;</hi> The Snake lyes hid in the Graſs.</p>
            <p>Some Men, and thoſe of no ſmall Note, will employ their VVives to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit their Buſineſs, knowing they are often more ſucceſsful than Men. I think, there are but few Caſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is lawful for a Man to take his Pleaſure, and ſend his VVife to ſpeak and ſollicit for him. If the Husband be in Priſon, the Honour of the Family at ſtake; if his good Name be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, his Employment depend upon it; if it be to get leave for him to come
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108575:65"/>
home, when abſent, or to ſecure the Life of a Son; in theſe Caſes, and no other, it is fit for a VVoman to appear in Buſineſs, and even then it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and does not always anſwer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
            <p>A certain great Miniſter uſed to give Audience to Ladies, without his Houſe, in a place ſo retired, it was ſuſpicious. Two Men of Quality carried their VVives thither, to ſolicit their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and putting them in, withdrew; others took notice of it, and one of them ſaid, <hi>Indeed, it was not well done of thoſe Gentlemen to withdraw, for their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence credited their Buſineſs:</hi> another Anſwered, <hi>That is a Jeſt, thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do not deſire to credit, but to do their Buſineſs.</hi> It was an excellent Saying of the Count <hi>de Vimioſo, That he who loſes his Honour to do his Buſineſs, loſes both Honour and Buſineſs.</hi> Let no Man of Sence and Honour, endeavour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance himſelf with ſuch Danger. VVhat can he expect to gain at laſt, whoſe very Beginnings are built upon Loſſes! Prudent Merchants inſure their Goods of moſt Value. A Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous VVoman muſt be like that Saint,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108575:66"/>
who never appears but in great Storms, and then it is to bring help. Let her be ready to aſſiſt in the Misfortunes of her Houſe, and to eaſe the Troubles of her Husband and Children: Let her endeavour to deliver him and them from Diſaſters: Let her be their Voice, not their Sollicitor. She may ſtrive to help out in caſes of Neceſſity, not to carry on an Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Married Women are pleaſed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, when their Husbands tell them what they know, what they hear, and what News there are about the Town. To be too reſerved, is the way for a Man to be hated; to be too open, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible way to be deſpiſed. A Man muſt chooſe a Medium between both thoſe Extreams, ſo that his Wife may not think he ſlights her, nor he give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to be undervalued by her. Our Women have a Saying, <hi>That he who loves me, tells me what he knows, and gives me what he has.</hi> A diſcreet Man will never tell his Wife the Stories of his Youthful Amours and Intrigues: for they produce two ill Effects; the one, that they diſcover their own Frailties, the other, that they ſhew them how
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108575:66"/>
eaſily ſome Women are drawn in. He muſt by no means, ever entertain them with the Failings of other VVomen; but, if things happen to be mentioned that are ſo notorious, they cannot be deny'd, he may excuſe them, or evade the Diſcourſe. Let him always menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Things with horror, and lay all the blame of ſuch Miſcarriages upon the Husband, ever excuſing the Wife. This will denote, that a good Husband will not fail of a good Wife, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happens; and that he being ſuch, expects the like return from her.</p>
            <p>We often ſee Married Women of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted Reputation, keep company, and be familiar with ſome, whoſe Credit is either quite loſt, or runs very low. Much Prudence is requiſite in this caſe; but the ſafeſt courſe, is wholly to avoid them. Honour is like a Looking-glaſs, any Stroke breaks it, and the leaſt Breath clouds it. Perhaps, ſome are the more free to converſe with ſuch Women, relying upon their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Fame. But the ignorant Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, either cannot, or will not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between Good and Evil: For the moſt part, he who Shoots, hits not
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108575:67"/>
exactly the Mark, but near it; ſo Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious Tongues being about to ſpeak ill of any Perſon, hit not at firſt upon the right, and perhaps defame thoſe who are next to them. I have always recourſe to the moſt natural and eaſy Compariſons; and am therefore ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in this caſe, when I conſider, that one only drop of Ink falling into a Bottle of fair Water, is enough to diſcolour it all, and that a Hogſhead of fair Water is not ſufficient to make a ſmall Vial of Ink clear. This is the caſe between a good and bad Reputation; the beſt can never wipe off the Stains of the bad, and the bad always ſullies that which is never ſo good. We find, Health is not catching as Diſeaſes are; therefore it was well ſaid, <hi>That Good is not like the Itch, but Evil perhaps may be ſo.</hi> The diſcreet Management of the Husband, muſt draw a Woman from ſuch Company. A Friend of mine behaved himſelf ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly well in this Caſe: He always preſſed his Wife to Viſit, go Abroad, and keep Company with ſuch and ſuch Ladies, of whoſe Integrity and Good Name he was fully ſatisfied; and by this means continually hindred her from Viſiting, going Abroad, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108575:67"/>
Company with others, of whom he did not ſo well approve.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Among the many ill Cuſtoms, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty has introduced in <hi>England,</hi> none has prevailed more than this, which is one of the worſt that is, for Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Women to keep company with ſuch as are Lewd, or have the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of being ſuch. I am of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ladies of the firſt Quality, are the firſt who gave way to this Abuſe, making themſelves familiar with the Miſtreſſes of Kings, and as the inferior Ranks ſtrive to mimick all their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo they could not forbear imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation even in this, and it is thereby deſcended to all Degrees. There is now little or no diſtinction between the Wife and the Miſs, they all herd together, and they having made this Equality between themſelves, no wonder if Men make no great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the reſpect they pay to both. The greateſt Ladies are Guilty of the greateſt Crime, they not only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the fault, but gave the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The others are equally Guilty in the practice, though not ſo Criminal in the ſcandal. Strange, that thoſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108575:68"/>
who ſhould be the Patterns of Honour and Virtue, have ſo much degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to Countenance Infamy and Vice, by aſſociating themſelves with the Profeſſors of it; as if the Bed of a King ſanctified Lewdneſs, or the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Dutcheſs and Counteſs, would wipe away the Name of a Proſtitute. This has incourag'd Men to keep, and Women to be kept by them in the face of the World, the difference of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect being now ſo little, or rather none between a Wife, and a Wench. The effect of this Converſation is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious enough; what elſe is it has De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched ſo many Women well born, and what is it elſe that has made the Credit of moſt Women ſo dubious? If you handle Pitch ſomething will ſtick, if you keep ill Company, you will get ſome ill haunt. Every one is to be known by this Company, if a Man is always among Thieves, he muſt expect to be thought one of them, if a Woman among W—res, ſhe cannot avoid the Imputation. The Marry'd Woman that values her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that loves Virtue, and deſires to promote the Peace of her Family,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108575:68"/>
will abhor ſuch Company, and fly ſuch Converſations. A prudent Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, if he find his VVife the leaſt inclin'd to it, will diſſwade, will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, and when other means fail, muſt make uſe of his power, and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to draw her from it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt VVives look upon it as unkind or uncivil, in the Husband to extol the Beauty, Air, Shape, or good Parts of other VVomen; yet it may be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if it goes not too far. In this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular a Man may take his Meaſures from the Humour, Age, Beauty and good Qualities of his VVife; for they who have a Stock of their own, are better pleaſed to hear the perfections of others ſpoke of.</p>
            <p>A Man of Quality diſcourſing with his VVife (whoſe Ingenuity and VVit far exceeded his) highly commended the Beauty and good Parts of another VVoman. The VVife bore with it as long as ſhe could, but finding him ſtill proceed, ſhe ſaid, <hi>To be Reveng'd for your ſo much extolling that Lady, I could only wiſh you were Marry'd to her, that you might ſlight her, and to ſee how ſhe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108575:69"/>
would behave her ſelf, when you ſhould praiſe me as you do her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This does not hinder a Man from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complaiſant and civil among the Ladies, when there is occaſion for it, for all Men of Honour are oblig'd to it; and Matrimony does not debar us, that Liberty which is commendable, and decent, ſo it exceed not the bounds of courteſy and good Manners.</p>
            <p>The King and Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to Ride out, the Queen looking out of the Window, ſaw the Kings Horſe paſs along by her Mare without taking any notice of her. The Queen call'd out to the Maſter of the Horſe, and Commanded him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to cut off that Horſes Legs, for ſhe was reſolv'd the King ſhould never Mount him again. The Maſter of the Horſe ask'd, what he ſhould ſay to the King, for ſo doing, ſhe reply'd, <hi>Tell him it was becauſe he paſs'd by ſo Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Mare as mine without Neighing, and a Horſe that has ſo little Mettle, is good for nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Liberty is not common to the Woman as well as the Husband, whoſe priviledge is much leſs in this caſe, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:108575:69"/>
yet no wrong done her; as the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes of one Town may be much larger than thoſe of another, and yet this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may have no juſt cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. Let not a Wife preſume to praiſe another Man, either in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or abſence of her Husband, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be in things indifferent, and which are not eſſential to the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Man.</p>
            <p>
               <q>There can be nothing more unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than to ſee VVomen ſet up for Judges of the Shape, Behaviour and Parts of all the Men they ſee. Some there are will ſo nicel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> delineate, and ſo curiouſly deſcribe every Fop, one would think they ſpent their Life in the Study of Man. Others praiſe with ſuch eagerneſs and concern, they give more occaſion to ſuſpect they are moved by Affection, than the bare conſideration of Merit. Neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a VVife, who ought to ſtudy and admire none but her Husband, all the reſt of Mankind ought to paſs as if unſeen, or ſeen ſo as not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A Young Marry'd Man is allow'd to be Gay, and uſe all the Ornaments of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108575:70"/>
apparel that are becoming. VVedlock is the high State he aimed at, and all things being more perfect in their higheſt Elevation, than whilſt they aſcended or decline, all things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to his accompliſhment, are good and Lawful in a Marry'd Man. Coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apparel, and all exterior Ornaments were deſign'd for Husbands and Lovers; for it is to be ſuppoſed all the Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Dreſs tends to pleaſe the VVife, or the Miſtreſs; on which account it is much more commendable, than if it were deſign'd only to content and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy himſelf. Cuſtom has made a great alteration in theſe Affairs amongſt us, and in truth if it be not for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I think at leaſt it is not for the worſt. Our Forefathers uſed to ſay; <hi>A Man ſhould ſmell of Gunpowder, and a Woman of Frankincenſe.</hi> Hereby ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, the former ſhould be employ'd in Warfare, and the latter in the Church. It is not long ſince a great Lady not a little conceited, uſed to cenſure a Courtier for uſing Perfumes, and he hearing of it, ſent her word, <hi>That if her Ladiſhip could once bring her ſelf to ſmell of Frankincenſe, he would
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108575:70"/>
ſoon prevail with himſelf to ſmell of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The neatneſs of Rooms, Curioſity of Apparel, and ſuchlike things Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by the Antients, are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come practicable, and are not vicious in the uſe, but the abuſe. There is difference between foppiſhneſs and neatneſs. And that we may not be wholly diſguſted with the modern Cuſtoms, nor thoſe who affect to be Rigid, pretend to Confound us with the purity of the Antients; who would believe, that in the Reign of King <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> when Men to flatter the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant fiery Temper of the King, would be thought to be made of Iron, it was the faſhion for Young Noble Men, to lean upon their Pages when they walk'd, as now a days the Ladies do; and that ill Cuſtom ſo far prevail'd, that when they Play'd at Tennis, they would not change their Stations as is uſual without the help of thoſe Pages. They protracted their Words, and all in general minc'd them, and talk'd effeminately. This ſhews, it is not the Age that makes Cuſtoms better or worſe, but the Quality; nor is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108575:71"/>
to deſpiſe what now is, only to magnify what was.</p>
            <p>
               <q>There are a conceited ſort of Men, who never give over Railing at our preſent Faſhions, not that they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like them, but to be thought Wiſer than all the VVorld. Nothing will down with them, but former Ages; and this is only a miſtaken Affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be thought well-read; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in reality, nothing more expreſſes their Ignorance. I cannot believe, the VVorld was ever better or wiſer than it is; for, if we conſult Hiſtory, we ſhall find no Age, but abounded in VVickedneſs and Folly as much as ours can do; and, if we read the antienteſt of Poets, we ſhall find nothing they exerciſe their VVits in more than Satyr, in expoſing and rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Vices of their Times. Even as it was then, ſo it is now; none more vicious than thoſe Poets, who ſo much exclaimed againſt Vice; none more depraved, than thoſe who now revile the preſent Age. And to ſhew the Faſhions then, were no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable or decent, than what we now uſe; let but every one reflect,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108575:71"/>
What could be more ridiculous or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, than a Steeple Crown-Hat, a Starch'd Ruff, Slaſhed Sleeves, a little Doublet, great wide knee'd Breeches, like a pair of Petticoats, an inſeparable ſhort Cloak, and eternal Boots? How incomparably more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and convenient, is the Garb now in uſe? a Hat that has nothing ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, a careleſs eaſy Cravat, a Coat fit to the Body, Breeches ſhaped to the Thighs, and Shooes proper for the Seaſon. How much better is a VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans High-head, than a little Coif; her Hair in a ſmall Curl, or quite Plain, than long dangling Locks; a a Gown ſhaped to the Body upon Stays, than a ſtiffned Jerkin; the Sleeves to cover the Arms, than tacked upon the Shoulders; their Coats eaſy about them, than ſtuck out upon a Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Fardingal? Yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, it is Cuſtom that makes all things appear well or ill; thoſe Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons pleaſed our Forefathers, and we are delighted with theſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I look upon it as very improper, for a Man to be always Undreſſed in the Houſe; if it were not troubleſom, I
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108575:72"/>
would adviſe, to wear the ſame Garb at Home as Abroad. A Man dreſſed, appears more Awful and Majeſtick. This is plain; for that Great Men do not receive Viſits, or expoſe themſelves to be publickly ſeen in a careleſs Habit; but at ſuch times, only admit Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or particular Perſons, of whoſe reſpect they are ſufficiently ſatisfyed.</p>
            <p>To Fondle and Dally with ones Wife at Table, before Servants, (much uſed by many Men) is very indecent, a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening of the Gravity and Stayedneſs of the Husband, and contrary to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of the VVife. In this caſe, if the Man wants Diſcretion to refrain, the VVoman ought to have the Prudence to obſtruct it.</p>
            <p>The ſame Practice towards Children, is much to be condemned. I ſaw once a great General beſet with many Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Note that attended him, break through them all, and run to meet and kiſs a little Son that was coming to him; all the Spectators gazing and admiring, that a Perſon ſo conſiderable, ſhould have ſo little command of himſelf: I declare, had it been in my power, I would inſtantly have broke him; for it
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:108575:72"/>
is not ſo great a demonſtration of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Reſolution, to ſuppreſs the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Hatred; as it is to Conquer the irregular motions of Love. Fathers will ſay, They are the beſt Judges in this caſe; for thoſe who are not ſuch, cannot ſo well limit the force of their Love. They may ſay what they pleaſe, but I ſhall never recant what I have ſaid. All the VVorld is ſatisfyed, that a Looker on, ſees more than he that Plays. Since we have ſpoke of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, let us go through with it at once. It is as reaſonable to wiſh for, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them. This Deſire muſt not be ſo extravagant, as to diſcompoſe, or oblige a Man to any Exceſs. Young Married People may always hope with Aſſurance. Since we have made uſe of Proverbs, that Old Saying will ſave us from trouble, and is not unfit for this purpoſe, that <hi>We muſt not lye in the Ditch, and cry God help us:</hi> We muſt pray to God, and at the ſame time uſe human Means. God deliver you from Medicines, Baths, extravagant Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, fruitfulneſs by Sanctified Touch or Bleſſing of Hypocrites, ſtrange Mountebanks, Chymical Preparations,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:108575:73"/>
new-found Potions and unknown Plaſters. All that is required, is to be much a Man, and more a good Chriſtian; to reſign ones ſelf to the Will of God, be pleaſed with what he ſends, which is always more for our Intereſt than what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
            <p>When you have Children, never tell of their pretty Actions, or ſeem over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed at their Wit; that only ſerves to make them Rude, and is no Credit to the Father. Mothers would have the Fathers take them in their Arms, and Play with them; if ever you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to commit this Weakneſs, let it be very private, that none ſee it, no more than you would be ſeen Stealing, or committing any other Crime. It does not belong to a Man, to make himſelf his Child's Nurſe, or Cradle. It is very prepoſterous to make Grimaces, and ſpeak to them in their own imperfect Language: it ſuffices to ſee, love and take care of their Education. All other Fondneſs belongs to the Mothers, who are not at all to be imitated in thoſe Actions, nor that Care and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uſurped by the Father.</p>
            <p>I juſt now remember a Paſſage which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108575:73"/>
ſhall not be omitted, 'tho perhaps it may not be thought much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: A great Miniſter (who was much Courted) had a little Son, that uſed to come into the Room, where he heard all Men of Buſineſs; among the reſt, there was one very Antient, of great Quality, and who had Affairs of great importance in hand; he uſed to Converſe very much with the Child; and the Spirit of Diſſimulation and Flattery had ſo far taken poſſeſſion of him, that he did many abſurd things; and another, who had Buſineſs there, and ſaw it, ſaid of him, <hi>Indeed, it is ſtrange, that Intereſt ſhould make ſuch a one leſs among another Man's Children, than Love makes us among our own.</hi>

            <p>Take what follows for a Jeſt, or for Advice, which you pleaſe: When God gives you any Daughters, let every one have but one uſual and eaſy Name, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Fancy or Devotion. I look upon the Cuſtom of giving a whole Catalogue of Names, and many hard and extravagant ones at laſt, to be very impertinent: Women are much addicted to this new ſort of ſop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh affected Grandeur; and ſometimes

it happens, that ſhe who was Chriſtned, and always known to be plain <hi>Mary</hi> or <hi>Frances,</hi> heaps upon her ſelf a dozen other hard Names, that are enough to puzzle an Univerſity; and this they do, only becauſe they heard ſuch and ſuch Ladies ſo called.</p>
            <p>This Tale is not unpleaſant: In a Neighbouring Village, the Daughter of a Yeoman was carryed to be Baptized; he underſtanding a Noble Man's Child had not long before, received Three Names there in Baptiſm; this Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur being cheap, he reſolved to ſtrain the Point yet farther, and ordered his Daughter ſhould have Four Names. The Curate having heard them, ſaid to the Godfathers, <hi>Gentlemen, chooſe one of all theſe Names, for I have a weak Memory; or elſe, I vow, I will Baptize her without any Name, or ſend her home as ſhe came, till ye there agree what Name to fix upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had like to have omitted one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that deſerves to be conſidered, and which ought not to be paſſed in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſince I handle ſo many ſmall Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: Men very often are guilty of one Extream or other, when their
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:108575:75"/>
Wives are in Labour; ſome are as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and buſy as the Midwife, others fly, and think they can never be far enough from them. An arch Youth, who was of the latter Humour, uſed to ſay, <hi>That if he Married, it ſhould be in</hi> July. And being asked, <hi>Why?</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Becauſe, if I prove ſo unlucky as to have my Wife Lye-In, it may fall out in</hi> March, <hi>and then I may find Shipping for</hi> India, <hi>whither I will chooſe to go, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſee her in that condition.</hi> The love a Man bears his VVife, may be the beſt Counſellor upon this occaſion, and this natural Inclination will guide him. I blame not thoſe who at that time would wiſh, they could be every thing for to be aſſiſting; I condemn thoſe that will be nothing: it is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to go abroad, becauſe there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Accidents wherein a Man's Preſence is required; it is enough for every Man to be in his Chamber, and there with an equal conſtancy, receive the Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or Diſmal News. The Saying of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nobleman, will be ſome Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion amidſt this ſerious Diſcourſe; He was a General, and one of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſent him a Letter, begging leave
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108575:76"/>
to go home, to be preſent at the Birth of a Child: The General writ this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; <hi>I would be glad to be at home when I had a Child, but to be preſent at the Birth, ſignifies nothing.</hi>

            <p>The Corruption of the World, which daily encreaſes, has introduced chooſing of luſty Country-women for Nurſes, inſtead of Vertuous and well Qualifyed Women, as was formerly uſed. VVe firſt deſcended from Mothers to Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and are now come from good Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to bad ones; but, it is the Faſhion, ſo let it paſs. Yet, it ſeems to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Duty of the Mother; for as a VViſe Man obſerved, <hi>She maintains us nine Months in her Bowels, before ſhe ſees or knows us; then, why when ſhe ſees and knows us, does ſhe caſt us off, and find another to maintain us?</hi> I could wiſh to ſee the Children of my Friends ſuck good Milk, not only in relation to the Soundneſs of the Nurſes Body, but to the good Diſpoſition of her Soul.</p>

               <q>I have not hitherto in any Point, oppoſed the Opinion of my Author; not becauſe it was infringing the Rules of a Tranſlation, but becauſe his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels have been good, and not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected

againſt with Reaſon. I muſt incur the Cenſure of ſome preciſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers of Antiquated Cuſtom, but I hope the Ladies will be of my ſide. I have already Spoke as to the regard due to Antiquity, when Experience has taught us better, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Cuſtoms than our Forefathers left us. It is to me prepoſterous, that a Man can pretend to Love his VVife, or indeed to have any regard for his own ſatisfaction, and oblige the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Nurſe it. can a Man make a Slave of her he Loves? Can he be pleaſed, ſhe ſhould not have a quiet Night? Can he be ſatisfied to ſee her want an Hour of Reſt in the Day? There is nothing more vain, than to think a Child is the leſs belov'd for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bred abroad, the Eyes of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may be upon it, and nothing will be wanting. But ſuppoſing a Man to have ſo little regard of his VVife, yet ſtill ſure in reſpect to his own quiet and ſatisfaction, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endure all the impertinencies that attend the Breeding of Infants. Milk is the Nouriſhment of the Body and not of the Soul, therefore, provided
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108575:77"/>
a Nurſe be Sound and Healthy, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive what danger there can be in the Breaſt. I ſhall as ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it may alter the ſhape, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of a Child. As for the VViſe Parallel between Nouriſhing the Child in the VVomb, and Suckling it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is Born, it is not at all pertinent; for no Argument can be drawn to prove, that becauſe a VVoman en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures the Pain that Nature has indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably laid upon her during that time, ſhe muſt intail Miſery on her ſelf for ever; and doubtleſs there is none, even the fondeſt of Mothers, who if it were poſſible at any rate to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſufferings of Child-bearing to another, would not think the purchaſs cheap, though at never ſo great a Price.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To preſcribe Rules for the Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Children, is a matter of too large Extent, and a Subject deſerving a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Treatiſe, the buſineſs in hand, is only to give ſome Inſtructions for a Marry'd Life, towards making it the more eaſy and pleaſing.</p>
            <p>This is a proper place to ſpeake of Baſtard Children, a very needleſs, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:108575:77"/>
often troubleſome ſort of Creatures to Marry'd People; but when they are had, they muſt be taken care for, and cannot be Sold to the Plantations. Therefore ſomething muſt be ſaid in Relation to them. Natural Children gotten out of Wedlock deſerve to be Cheriſhed, as long as there are none Lawfully begotten. There have been ſo many Famous Men in the World of that ſort, that I would not have them ſlighted too ſoon. I think a few words will ſerve to Direct and Inſtruct the Fathers, the greateſt difficulty is what advice to give to the Wives of ſuch Fathers. Such there are, ſo generous, they entertain, and cheriſh with Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs their Husband's Children, others cannot endure, but abuſe and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them. <hi>Margaret de Valois,</hi> Queen of <hi>France</hi> (before mention'd) behav'd her ſelf with notable Gallantry in this caſe. She was in Bed with <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, Sirnamed the Great, who was very falſe to her, and perceiv'd he was much concern'd, becauſe word was privately brought him, that Madomoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle <hi>de Foſeuſe</hi> one of her Ladies, and the King's Miſtreſs, was in Labour within
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:108575:78"/>
the ſame Palace. The Queen Dreſt her ſelf, and went to the Labour of that Servant who ſerv'd her ſo ill, ſhe ſaw her well attended, and took care to ſave her Reputation, Commanding all thoſe that had aſſiſted her, upon Pain of her diſpleaſure, not to Divulge what had happened. If all Women would follow this Example, they might well be entruſted with thoſe Children, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd Byblows: but conſidering there are few ſuch, the beſt way is to Breed them not only out of the Houſe, but out of the Town where they Live. Theſe Children are never to be caſt off, or totally abandoned, for though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate in their Birth, they retain the Name of the Family, and very often through Want fall into many Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which redound to the Diſcredit, and Burden the Conſcience of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Church and the Sea are the common Receptacles of this ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: It will be Prudent to Breed them up to one of them.</p>
            <p>This is a proper place to put you in Mind of Correcting a looſe and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly courſe of Life, which the more a Man-follow'd before Wedlock, the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108575:78"/>
more he ought to ſhun after. When a Priſoner happens to break Goal and make his Eſcape, though he be at ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great a diſtance, he thinks not himſelf ſafe as long as any part of his Chains is remaining about him. Fly the very thoughts of all paſt Vices as you would the Plague, caſt off all the Youthful Wild Delights, and do not offer ſo much as to look back towards them, not even to ſee how far they are from you. It was an excellent Fiction of the Poets, that <hi>Orpheus,</hi> when he went to Hell was in no danger there, till being come out again, he look'd back. That is really the moſt deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eſtate, when a Man after leaving a wicked courſe, falls back into it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Many Men (I know not with what Confidence of themſelves) entertain Familiar and Expenſive Friendſhip with Modeſt Ladies, and believe they no way wrong their Wives. But the Conſequences are often very bad; for moſt Marry'd Women are at firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the extravagant Expences, and Diſorders of their Husbands, and by degrees fall into perfect Jealouſy.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:108575:79"/>
Nor can they be blam'd, for it is no leſs wrong in a Husband to be defective in the tenderneſs, and affection he owes to his Wife, than in any part of that which is moſt generally and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call'd the Matrimonial Debt; but the Injury will be ſo much the greater, when offered to one who places all her ſatisfaction in the Kindneſs and Love of her Husband.</p>
            <p>I will not ſo ſlightly run over the Word Jealouſy, which is a Hell upon Earth, whether a Man be infected with it himſelf, or infect his Wife. It is the greateſt of Plagues among Men, it takes away all quiet of Mind, and moſt cruelly Torments thoſe it is once poſſeſt of. It has been, and is ſtill much diſputed, whether is the greater Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a Man to be Jealous, or give occaſion to his Wife to be ſo. I will not decide it, but abhor either. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there are, who make no account of adminiſtring cauſe of Jealouſy, but are highly concern'd at the leaſt Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow offered them. This is a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Overſight, for generally the cauſe given is grounded upon ſtrong Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, though ſo little reſpected, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:108575:79"/>
that which a Man takes to himſelf, and ſo highly reſents, is raiſed only by Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; and Women being more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful than frail, it often happens their revenge has more fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences than their frailty could have. It was ingeniouſly ſaid by me, <hi>That Jealouſy is like God; for it makes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of nothing.</hi> This is its property, and therefore ought to be baniſhed the Houſes of all Wiſe Men, and good Chriſtians. The Torment Men and Women endure by this curſed Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is incredible, and therefore with good reaſon it has been called a Viper which kills them, that bring it forth. I adviſe all Marry'd Men to ſhun this Plague; and that they do not give occaſion to kindle that Flame in thoſe they love or ought to love, which they ſo much, and ſo juſtly dread in themſelves. An Ingenious Man uſed to ſay, That when a Man once gave his Wife to underſtand he was Jealous of her, he was gone half way towards making her give him an occaſion to be ſo: Alluding to that Saying, that Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our is as good as half the Journey perform'd. As the Law has not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108575:80"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Jealous Thought, as not believing there can be any occaſion for it. I muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between Prudence and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, Prudence prevents, removes and cuts off all occaſions of ſuſpicion. Jealouſy does nothing of this nature, but on the contrary, a Man muſt be cautious and Prudent to avoid being Jealous. I will explain my ſelf by a Compariſon. A Prudent Man is like the Commander of a Fort, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually by Day and Night has his Spies abroad to obſerve all Enemies, though he know of none, that if any ſhould ariſe, he may not be ſurpriz'd. Such a one Lives ſecure, Eats with comfort, and Sleeps at eaſe. A Jealous Man is like another Commander, who fearing what is, and what is not, ſhuts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up in his Fort, is afraid of the Wind that blows, and ſuſpects the Motion of the Leaves, and therefore without any Honour or Profit leads his Life in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual frights and ſuſpitions, without knowing the comfort of Peace and Tranquility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:108575:80"/>Here by the way I would put all thoſe that ſhall happen to Read this Pamphlet in mind, they muſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe I preſcribe ſo much cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſervedneſs, my Deſign is to raiſe Jealouſy between Marry'd Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but rather that I propoſe ſo many Methods of Security to take away all cauſe of Suſpition. There is no doubt, the Obligation would be much the greater to a Doctor, that would keep us in Health when well, than if he ſhould let us fall Sick, and then Cure us.</p>
            <p>Gaming, in all ſorts of People, is a ſcandalous Employment in caſe they make it their Buſineſs; otherwiſe it may be only a Diverſion, or Paſtime moſt peculiar to great Men, who want other Affairs to take up their Time. I would eaſily agree to Play as much as is juſtifiable, if I could preſcribe how far it is lawful; but I yet find it a greater difficulty to curb the dangerous paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thoſe who Play are ſubject to, as Anger and Covetouſneſs. Upon very ſlender matters a Diſpute is ſet on foot, and that is improv'd to a Quarrel, where Life and Honour are at Stake; for it is not the value of the thing Men inſiſt
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:108575:81"/>
upon, but the nature of the diſpute. There are ſo many Examples of the Miſchiefs cauſed by Play, ſo many diſaſters follow it, they need not be repeated, our own experience can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us. A diſcreet Man was uſed to ſay, that Wine, Tobacco and Play ought to be Sold like Drugs at the Apothecaries-Shops. VVhen a Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor Plays he ventures what is his own, if we may allow what he loſes to be his. A Marry'd Man Plays what belongs to others, for he has right but to his ſhare of what belongs to his Family, and conſequently his VVife, Children and Servants have their's. Then how can he with a ſafe Conſcience, venture and loſe what belongs to others.</p>
            <p>A Nobleman who was much given to Gaming, had a Daughter he dearly loved. Being once at Play, he loſt his Money, and ſent ſeveral times home for Jewels and other things of value, which were the beſt part of his Daughter's Portion. She reſenting it, as ſhe had reaſon, went to the place where he was at Play, and he much ſurprized to ſee her, ask'd, what ſhe wanted in that place, ſhe anſwer'd,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:108575:81"/>
               <hi>Sir, I am come, that you may Play me away to, for it is to no purpoſe to keep me after loſing all I was to have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One who praiſed Gaming, called it <hi>The Academy of Patience.</hi> It might be ſtiled ſo, if Patience were to be learnt there, as it is worn out. I am often conſidering the Slavery of a Gameſter, and can never ſufficiently admire at it: for when Judgment is given againſt him, tho' in a matter of ſmall moment, by a Stander-by, and confirmed by two or three more, yet he raiſes Objections, appeals, protracts the time, and at laſt, either he does not pay, or at leaſt he complains; and then, they are ſo obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to a pair of Dice, that they part with their Money, becauſe 6 came up before 8, or 11 followed 7. I confeſs, I can never conceive, Why in the one caſe they ſhould be ſo obſtinate, and ſo ſubmiſſive in the other! To conclude with Gaming, I will only add a witty Expreſſion of one of our Courtiers: He uſed to ſay, He wiſh'd his Enemies but three Plagues, to be Reveng'd of them, <hi>To ask more than ſhould be given them, to lay Wagers they ſhould loſe, and Play more Money than they ſhould win.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:108575:82"/>
               <q>When Gaming was practiſed upon the Square, and it was a Shame and Diſhonour to Cheat, then Play (tho' not good) was in ſome meaſure more excuſable. Now Play is no longer a Diverſion but a Fraud; and Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is accounted Wit and Skill, not Infamy and Vice; what Pretence can a Man (who has any to Sence and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,) have to Gaming? If he Plays fair, he loſes his Money, and is laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at for his Ignorance; if foul, he robs another; and tho' none elſe do, his Conſcience muſt accuſe him of the Wrong. There is no need to inſiſt much upon this Point, and it needs no Proof; all that know any thing, know it to be true, and to convince Stupidity, is impoſſible: But there are many Men generally cautious, and who will ſhun Playing high, yet think themſelves ſafe enough, ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring but a little; this is often the moſt tempting Bait, to draw them into Ruin. The Devil never puts Man upon the blackeſt Villanies at firſt; he draws him on by degrees, from one to another, till he plunges him beyond all Shame and Remorſe. Juſt ſo a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:108575:82"/>
Gameſter, who deſigns upon one that ſees not into his baſe Projects, allures him with Playing for what is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in value; then the more to pleaſe, lets him win: covetouſneſs ſoon overcomes his Reaſon, and the Winner believes this Gain is the effect of his good Play or Fortune, and it is only the Bait to deſtroy him. Thus blinded, he forgets his good Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, riſes on the confidence of his Succeſs, at one Caſt loſes what he had won, and in a few more, all he has of his own. Yet, ſuppoſing a Man to have ſo great a command of himſelf, as never to venture more than is very inconſiderable, ſtill of that he will have no ſatisfaction; for the Diverſion of Play conſiſts in the Chance, and the chief Pleaſure is, the hope to Win, tho' never ſo little. But he who meerly Plays for theſe Ends, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fail of both; for he has no Chance, and conſequently no Hopes to Win, becauſe thoſe to whom Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is a Trade, where they cannot propoſe a greater Profit, lay hold of the leſſer; Deceit in them is a Habit, and they cannot forbear it, tho' in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:108575:83"/>
matters of ſmall moment; or if they could, they would not, for fear leſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing Honeſty, any thing of it might ſtick to them. I have done with the Men, only one word to the Women. If it be unlawful in the Husband, who is Lord of all, to expoſe his Fortune to the hazard of Play, how much more is it to be condemned in the Wife; who is not Miſtreſs of her ſelf, much leſs of his Eſtate? Nor muſt they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, there is more Innocence, and conſequently leſs Danger among their Sex; Women are improved to all the Crafts of Men; they are as well Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in all the Frauds of Play; they uſe as little Conſcience, have leſs regard of Honour, and are under no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Puniſhment for Crimes of that nature. In fine, It is Villany to impoſe upon another, and Folly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ones ſelf to be impoſed upon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There is another Danger as great as any yet ſpoke of, which is, That of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly devoted, or rather be witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Friends; and ſome Men upon this account, mind nothing but Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Feaſting, Rambling, and Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them. The midling ſort of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:108575:83"/>
People are moſt expoſed to this Evil; or among the great ones, Friendſhip is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Damages that may accrue by it; however, it is good even for them, to be cautious. It looks ill, and is a fault in a Married man, to chooſe a wild extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Batchellor for his Friend; for Friendſhip conſiſting in Sympathy or Likeneſs, it would be a wonder, if the Married-man did not every thing he ſaw the Batchellor do.

A Man may, and ought upon ſome occaſion modeſtly to commend his Wives Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but not her Abilities; and even her Vertues, are not to be made the Subject of his common Diſcourſe. It may be lawful for a Married Man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and but ſeldom, to expreſs the Satisfaction he has of his Wives Parts and Abilities, to a Father, a Brother, ſuch near Relations, and to his moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Friends, when they are Men of known Sence and Gravity. There are many Men, and of no ſmall Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who pretending to be Courtly or
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:108575:85"/>
Witty, talk much in Publick, and praiſe their Wives Shapes and Limbs, which in my opinion, is moſt ſcandalous, and deſerves a ſevere Reprimand. I was aſtoniſh'd one day, talking with a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of good Note, and in Years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Wife being indiſpoſed of a Pain in one of her Breaſts, he told me, <hi>His Lady was much tormented, becauſe her Bubbies were very tender.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being one Winter Night in <hi>Flanders,</hi> in a Houſe where many Great Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted, one of the Company had ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſence, as to draw out his Wives Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to ſhew to the reſt; it was of that ſort of Pictures that are put into ſtrange Garbs, according to the fancy of the Painter, or the Owner; for Vice has invented as many Dreſſes to pleaſe the Eyes, as Sauces to delight the Palate. It hapned this Picture was in the Habit of an Enſign, and really very pleaſing. One of the Gueſts then in the Houſe, was a Youth of good Quality, but very much addicted to the Liberty uſed in that Country; and it being after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (as appeared by him more than any of the others,) it came into his Head to get the Picture out of the fooliſh Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108575:86"/>
hands, which he kiſſed and hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as freely, as if it had been his own Wives, ſaying, <hi>O my dear Enſign, my dear Enſign!</hi> and a thouſand Amorous Expreſſions. In fine, it run on to that height, that we fell together by the Ears, and it was a wonder ſome were not killed; yet the Shame and Scandal was great: and tho' thoſe People are not Jealous and Malitious, it gave much matter of Talk, and laſted long. All this was cauſed by the extravagant li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of that unthinking Husband.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Tho' all the Counſels here given, be very prudent and excellent, and well worthy the conſideration of every Man, that deſires to live in the State of Matrimony with Content and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; yet I think, there is not one more abſolutely neceſſary, and of greater conſequence than this laſt. If a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> bred in a Country, where it is a Crime to ſpeak of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Wife, and no Credit for a Man to diſcourſe of his own, could think this Advice ſeaſonable in that Country, where ſo much caution is uſed; how much more neceſſary is it here, where Men without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108575:86"/>
make their own or other Mens Wives, the Subject of their moſt diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Converſation. How prepoſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is it, to hear a Husband not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with extolling the Virtue and natural Endowments of his Wife, run into indecent Commendations of her Perſon, ſo as not to leave any Part of her Body, which as far as in him lyes, he does not expoſe to the view of thoſe that hear him? Sure, nothing can be a greater demonſtration of Folly, unleſs it be that of ſome others, who diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a Wife, only becauſe ſhe is ſo, can never ceaſe Railing in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and as if her Shame were not their own; publiſh all her Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not ſatisfied with that, often add whatever their Hatred and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice can ſuggeſt. To commend a Wife, is to extol ones ſelf, if we will allow Man and Wife to be one, as Chriſtianity teaches, it is raiſing the Deſires of lewd Men; and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, has already as much as in him lyes, wronged a Man of Honour; in this caſe, there needs not the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Wiſh, the Thought is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and that is ſeldom wanting
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:108575:87"/>
where ſuch Praiſes are inconſiderately laviſhed. If Praiſing be not allowable, how much leſs to reproach and ſlander a Wife? it is not only Reflection a Man ſhares, as ſhe is his ſecond Self, but that he brings upon his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for not making a better Choice; the Honour done to a VVoman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to her Husband; if he make her deſpicable in the Eyes of the World, he muſt ſhare in the Diſgrace. There is another more than Brutal Liberty, much practiſed by ſome, who think all that is Lewd will paſs for Wit; which is, to make their Jeſts, and divert themſelves with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of thoſe things, Modeſty and good Manners forbid us to name. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf, and the Cuſtom of all Ages, have preſcribed Rules of Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for our VVords, and yet there are men who believe, there is no greater VVit than infringing thoſe very Rules. I can only ſay, this is a horrid Practice, that all men either of Sence or Honour ought moſt carefully to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void; I will add no more, becauſe the Subject is ſuch as does not bear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of it, and Modeſty forbids touching any farther upon it. If there
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108575:87"/>
be occaſion for a man to ſpeak of his Wife, and to expreſs his Satisfaction, let it be with few Words, and always in general Terms, without ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to Particulars; but his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Behaviour are the Language will moſt fitly and beſt ſpeak her Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the Reſpect he ſhews, the Love he bears her, are the greateſt Orators to ſpeak for her; there is no Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick ſo much extols her, as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Kindneſs of her Husband. If a VVoman has Faults, it is his Duty (if poſſible) to correct, if not, at leaſt to hide and conceal them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Some men (led away by their open Nature, or the fierceneſs of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,) ſtick not to diſcover to their Wives, they ſhould not be ſorry to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come VVidowers; and tho' for the moſt part, they let fall theſe Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the way of Jeſts, Women gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally take them as real Diſcoveries of their Thoughts, and Tokens of their Diskindneſs, which is generally better repayed in the ſame Coin, than Love. Let every prudent man have a care of exerciſing this ſort of Raillery; but on the contrary, let his Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108575:88"/>
always expreſs that Love and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs he would expect from her. He muſt not do as is ſaid of one, whoſe Wife when ſhe lay a Dying, ſaid, <hi>She was very much troubled, ſhe had not, done ſuch and ſuch things;</hi> he anſwered, <hi>Madam, do you Die, and all ſhall be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have a great care of being too trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom and difficult to pleaſe, as many are, with their Wives and Families. The impertinence of many, is really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, who without any other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but barely becauſe they are in their own Houſes, are always Quarrelling and Complaining, tire all their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ordering firſt one thing, and then contradicting the ſame thing they commanded. Hatred is not kindled at once, but ſprings from Diſlike, and by degrees becomes Hatred; this often happens between Man and Wfe, their continual Cohabitation and Company, which ſhould increaſe Love and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, exciting in them Enmity and Loathing.</p>
            <p>Since I have told ſome ſuch Stories, I will not omit this: A Son of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Matron <hi>Margaret de Chaves,</hi> with whom I was well acquainted, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:108575:88"/>
from whoſe mouth I heard it, ſollicited the Canonization of his Mother at <hi>Rome</hi> with great importunity: Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. had remitted the Examination of the Matter to a Cardinal, who was already ſo weary of this young Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that he endeavoured to fly as ſoon as he ſaw him; it hapned, he came to ſpeak to him upon a day when the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal was more out of Humour than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and after he had told him his Buſineſs as uſual, the Cardinal replyed, <hi>Sir, it is needleſs to trouble our ſelves with farther Proofs of your Mothers Sanctity; do you but prove ſhe had patience to endure you, and the Pope will immediately declare her a Saint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, if we conſider how great a ſtock of Patience is required to bear with impertinent Men, who value themſelves upon being abſolute in their Houſes, and have no other way to ſhew it, but by tormenting and plaguing their poor VVives, we ſhall find they make a pleaſing Offering of Patience to Almighty God, and that they may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be received among the number of Saints. There is a ſort of Men given to Bawling, who upon the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108575:89"/>
would throw the Houſe out at the Windows, and who diſcover the Secret of their own ill Conditions, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it to all the Neighbourhood. God deliver us from that perverſe Cuſtom! It was a good Saying of one, <hi>That no body ſuffers ſo much, but if he looks upon the Sufferings of another, his own will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear tolerable enough.</hi> Proud and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Men are commonly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this Failing. The former think all Creatures were made to ſerve them; the latter will not allow any thing for Accidents: Both are moſt unhappy Failings; becauſe, being the Succeſs of Things, is not generally in our power; it happens, that every Year, Day, and Hour, they fall out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our Expectation: and theſe Diſappointments are no way remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Peeviſhneſs.</p>
            <p>It will not be amiſs, to remember thoſe who ſuffer their Affections to ſtray towards their Maids, to the great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the Reputation of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to which they are falſe, and deſerve an Exemplary Puniſhment. The very Birds of Prey that live upon what they find, generally go far from home, to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:108575:89"/>
ſeek their Food. Why then ſhould Men be leſs cautious and wary? Tho' all manner of unlawful Converſation with Women, be of very dangerous conſequence to Man, yet none ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely pernicious as that which is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained within his own Houſe. The diſorderly proceeding of the Maſter is ſoon known to the Family, the ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample prevails, one Vice creates ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and thus they multiply till they bring on ſome unexpected Misfortune on the Family. The Maids finding themſelves belov'd by their Maſter, Plot againſt their Miſtreſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive ſuch Deviliſh Miſchiefs, that not ſatisfy'd with the firſt wrong, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten endeavour to deprive them of their Honour, and ſometimes of their Lives. Some hope hereby to ſucceed in their places (as it often happens) and others the more freely to follow their diſſolute courſe of Life. Hence follow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Lamentable Tragedies, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſcandalous Marriages.</p>
            <p>Having given ſeveral Counſels rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Government of the Soul in the practice of Virtue; it is Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to preſent you with ſome precepts
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:108575:90"/>
touching the Management of the Houſe, which with more Elegancy by Philoſophers, is Stil'd the <hi>OEconomical Virtue,</hi> and is the ſecond part of Civil Learning, which is alſo the ſecond of Moral Philoſophy. This, in fine, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Prudence, and Induſtry, wherewith the Citizen, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the great and the ſmall Govern their Families; which in Princes is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and Matter of State, howſoever the Philoſophers term it.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Roman</hi> General, who believ'd he who underſtood well how to order a Feaſt, might know how to draw up an Army; had been much more in the right, had he ſaid, he might well Govern a common Wealth, who knew how to Govern his Houſe, for a City is nothing but a great Family, and a Family a little City.</p>
            <p>It happned one day, and to be the more exact, it was upon the Eve of the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> that I went to Viſit a Gentleman my Friend, and becauſe he Liv'd far from my Lodging, and it was in Winter, I thought I ſhould ſcarce find him at home by the time I got to his Houſe. He was a Young Man, and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:108575:90"/>
both his Wife and he were reputed to be but ill Managers of their Houſhold-Affairs. Being come to his Door, and having ſent in to know whether he was diſpoſed to receive my Viſit, whilſt a Page hurry'd about knocking at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Doors to enquire, I hear'd diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Voice within, that ſaid, <hi>Do you go to the Curat</hi>'s <hi>Houſe, and ask as from ſuch a one whether this be a Faſting-day or not. If he ſays a Faſting-day, go to the Market for Fiſh; if not, fetch Fleſh from the Butchers, make haſt that Dinner may be got ready.</hi> This was between one and two of the Clock. Conſider what a Life had the Servants of that Houſe, when the Maſters Liv'd in ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly manner. The Confuſion of a Family under a Negligent Maſter is not to be expreſſed. It is a common, but moſt true Saying, that When the Head akes all the Body is out of order. I was acquainted with a Man of great Quality and Underſtanding, but ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heedleſs of his Houſe, that he uſed to ſend for a certain Friend to come and Chide his Servants, and oblige them to mind their Duty. Theſe Extreams are related as monſtrous, and it is fit

to bear them in mind, the more to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor them.</p>
            <p>I reduce all the Government of a Houſe to two Heads, that is Diet and Cloathing, Rules well known to the Wiſe. By Diet is to be underſtood all neceſſaries and conveniencies requiſite within the Houſe; and by Cloathing, all that is for making an appearance Abroad. I have touched upon the Points before, but not ſo much as was neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Now to deſcend to particulars; it is requiſite the Maſter of the Family en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour always to ſupport it in that ſplendor and plenty, that his Fortune will afford, ſtill labouring that nothing may be wanting, either for Credit or Conveniency. The Table muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be ſo regularly ſupply'd, that it may be plentiful and orderly furniſhed, without any thing of Penury. It avails not to have plenty of all things brought in from abroad, if they are miſerably diſpenſed and delivered out at home. Servants are more apt to reſent the feeling of Want in the midſt of Plenty, than they would Liberality in Want.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:108575:91"/>Some Maſters think of nothing but hoarding Money, and neither Pay nor Cloath their Servants. I would not plead for Fortune, which ſometimes ſo orders it, that thoſe who Treat their Servants worſt, are beſt attended by them; but muſt appear in the behalf of Reaſon, which commands, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires him that would expect to have good Servants, to be a good Maſter. He that would have Servants to gueſs at his thoughts, ought to divine their wants. I hold it as a general Rule, That the Table ought to be more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than dainty, and the Cloathing more Sightly than Coſtly. Set-meals and proper times of Cloathing, ought to be obſerv'd. A great Lord uſed to ſay of one much inferior to himſelf, that Govern'd his Family very orderly, That he never ſo much wiſh'd for any thing as to be his Servant, becauſe his uſage to them was ſuch, that not only their Cloaths, but even their Perſons never grew Old.</p>
            <p>The beſt Pay, is that which is given in time. Let Servants have what is agreed upon, and Workmen the value of their Labour; he who does ſo, will
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108575:92"/>
be well Served by both: Good Service is to be rewarded, that Servants may be ready in time of need. Preſent Pay is beſt, though little; for if as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> ſay, he gives double who gives immediately, it is a ſign the readineſs of the Gift enhances the value. An ill Pay-maſter by delay ſo far offends his Creditors, they are ſcarce to be Reconciled with double their due. A certain Servant being ask'd, whom he waited upon, anſwered, <hi>I Serve my Son;</hi> and being again ask'd, what he meant by that, reply'd, <hi>I Serve my Heir.</hi> This gave occaſion to an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Man to ſay, it was a falſe Proverb, that a good Pay-maſter Inherits what is not his own; becauſe it is certain, he who pays not other Men their due, is heir to what does not belong to him. Let all things be Govern'd by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, not Pride, for the Effects of the former will be good and juſt, and thoſe of the latter Extravagant and Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. I would adviſe a Man of Quality to keep a decent, not a Hungry Table, that it be rather to feed the Mouth than the Eyes. That is, that it be more for uſe than Oſtentation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:108575:92"/>I will relate two Paſſages to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, both which I ſaw and had Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of to my own Coſt. There was a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> as great for his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as remarkable for Penury, he had daily Twelve Diſhes Serv'd up at Dinner, and as many at Supper with publick Ceremony, and it was certain only three of them had Meat, the other nine were carry'd along for form, but as empty as their Maſter's Head.</p>
            <p>I Knew another to whom by his place the reverſion of a Princes Table, whom he ſerv'd, belong'd. The Meat was carry'd to his Houſe and ſerv'd up to his own Table. Next it deſcended to his Son-and-Hier, who kept a Table apart, and Entertain'd Company, and by whom I was ſometimes Invited, and this was the third time thoſe Diſhes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in publick. But it ſtopp'd not there, for thence they went down to the cheif Servants, and from them to the Inferior, ſo that theſe Diſhes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in five ſeveral places before they were Conſum'd. This gave occaſion to a Servant of that Family, with the Native ſharpneſs of that Country to ſay: His Maſter was the greateſt Man
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108575:93"/>
in <hi>Spain,</hi> for that he was ſerv'd by Grandſons of Princes, becauſe all his Servants were but four degrees remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from his Highneſs. Alluding to the four Tables, by which the Diſhes gradually deſcended to them.</p>
            <p>So great is the power of vain Glory, eſpecially in our Age, that it flies at Nature, and overcomes it. For a Man to Eat well to ſupport Nature, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to Eat deliciouſly to pleaſe his Palate, is tolerable; but for him to Build a Reputation upon empty Diſhes brought in for ſhow as in a Play, is a Foppery, we ought to pray to God to deliver us from.</p>
            <p>Since we are ſpeaking of Eating, it is not amiſs to adviſe not to keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable Hours. It is very inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the Servants, and Maſters that require their attendance. If Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Buſineſs obliges a Man to Dine late; I would have the Servants Eat firſt, otherwiſe they ſuffer much, and the Houſe is never well ſerv'd, and it often happens when the Servants are to Dine after the Maſter, he loſes his Buſineſs, and ſlips his time for want of attendance. I highly approve of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108575:93"/>
up our antient Cuſtoms of keeping Servants well Fed, cheriſhing, and treating them with Kindneſs, which binds, and inclines them to love their Maſter.</p>
            <p>I would adviſe every Marry'd Man at ſome times of the Year without being ask'd, but of his own accord to make ſome Feaſts, and have ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Mirth and Paſtime in his Houſe, to pleaſe and divert his Wife and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Let him promote theſe things him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, they will be the more valued, he will be Cry'd up and Applauded for it, and indeed it is a ſign of good Nature to delight in ſeeing others pleaſed, and delighted with what is decent and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable. Not as our King <hi>Peter,</hi> Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the Cruel, who cauſed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be kept waking at Night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not Sleep. Let him contrive as often Entertainments abroad, whereof the meaneſt Servants may be partakers, that he may be thought eaſy and careful of their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Let him prudently ſhare with them of all extraordinaries as Preſents, and other unexpected Refreſhments. Some Men will rather ſuffer any Rarities
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:108575:94"/>
to rot and be thrown away, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow any on their Servants. There are ſome things, though mean and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in themſelves, very taking with the Family, that is affording them thoſe things that are or Cuſtom has made reaſonable at certain times of the Year, as Minc'd Pyes at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> Pancakes at <hi>Shrovetide,</hi> Pig at <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomewtide,</hi> Gooſe at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and the like; which though in themſelves of no moment, nor worth the mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet being uſual at thoſe Seaſons, are miſs'd by Servants if not had, and when had, ſatisfy and content them.</p>
            <p>I approve of going to Country Houſes, but not of continuing any time in them, not that it is any way unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, but extreamly troubleſom. It diſorders the Family, deſtroys the Goods, tires the Servants, nothing is ſav'd, rather more is ſpent, and a Man neither enjoys the quiet of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, nor the ſatisfaction of the Court. I mean thoſe Country Houſes, that are ſo near the Court, that one may go and come in a day, as is uſually done by thoſe who Live in them, which gave occaſion to a witty Man to ſay, that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:108575:94"/>
a certain Gentleman's Coach, made three Journeys a year to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> reckning how many Leagues the Coach travelled every day, going and coming between the Court and his Seat. Great Courtiers eſteem a Country Life intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, which of it ſelf it is not, but rather pleaſant and convenient. One of theſe being invited by a Friend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other company, to ſpend two or three days in a Country-Houſe of his, the ſecond day without taking leave of the others, ſet out towards the City; they called after him to ſtop, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving complyed, and being asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was going, he anſwered, <hi>My Freinds, I am going away, for if I ſpend above four and twenty Hours in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I fancy I am turned into a Beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am of Opinion, it is not convenient to live always at Court, and there are certain times proper for a Married Man to retire with his whole Family, to live upon his Eſtate, or where he ſhall judge moſt for his purpoſe. If I muſt preſcribe a certain Rule for the time of this Retirement; I judge when a Man-has above two Children, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt Seaſon. The time of his abſence
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108575:95"/>
from Court, ought to be while thoſe Children grow up, and it is no diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them not to be known, that is, till eight or ten Years of Age: Then it is fit to return to Court to introduce them, that the King may know them, and they know how to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at Court, which is very ſtrange and uncouth to thoſe who have not been bred in it; as is ſaid of the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts of <hi>Nile,</hi> the Noiſe whereof is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to ſtrangers, and ſcarce heard by the Natives that live about the place. The old Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who was Lord Steward of the Houſhold to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> uſed to ſay, <hi>If I am but two days without coming to Court, the third I ſtumble at the Mats, or elſe they laugh at me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now methinks, after this return to Court, a Man muſt not abſent himſelf till his Children are Married; and then they being diſpoſed of, that he retire to give reſt to his Old Age, and gain a Chriſtian Interval between Buſineſs and Death, which is the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Affair of Life. This method is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper for him that lives for himſelf, and upon himſelf; for I do not deſign
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:108575:95"/>
to adviſe a Miniſter of State, a Soldier, or Princes Servant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ho dayly Merits, and is in the way of Preferment, to quit his Profeſſion and Pretenſions, without very great reaſon. Where there is a ſufficient Cauſe, I am not againſt it; nor would I be ſo conceited to beleive, but any who hath ſufficient ground for ſo doing, would ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be led a way by the Counſel of a Man who has ſo ill governed himſelf. This ſort of Retreat is very advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous towards prolonging a Man's Life, preſerving his Health, ſparing his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and ſaving his Soul. As to Life, Men live longeſt in the Country; for Health is maintained by Exerciſe; the Eſtate is bettered becauſe leſs is ſpent, and Salvation is ſecurer, becauſe there are leſs Temptations to Sin, and the Thoughts are more free to be employed on God, and ones ſelf.</p>
            <p>Yet there are enow who contradict all this; for as one wiſely ſaid, <hi>Every Man gives a different Name to his Will:</hi> and therefore there has always been much controverſy about this manner of Retirement. An antient Gentleman boaſted, that he ſaved half his Eſtate by
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:108575:96"/>
what was not to be had. It was quite otherwiſe with a <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>paniard,</hi> who when Money grew ſcarce, gave out, he retired to the Country, and went not from Court, but ſayed, <hi>There was no way for a Man to recover and recruit himſelf, like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring half a dozen Pages and Footmen, without ſtirring one Foot from his Houſe.</hi> Theſe Retreats are often very much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Women, and they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſo much the more vigorouſly to divert ſuch Reſolution of their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, by how much they are the more great at Court, have the more Relations, or are more in Vogue. In this caſe, I can ſay no more than was ſaid by a Miſer, to one who would bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſome Money of him, offering ſeven Reaſons that ſhould oblige him to ſend it; the Miſer replyed, <hi>Thoſe ſame ſeven Reaſons I have, for not doing what you deſire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I can not avoid putting in a word touching ſome Husbands, who ſtudy nothing more, but how to be always abſent from Home, upon long Journeys and Voyages, ſome of their own ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and others which they do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevent, leaving young
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108575:96"/>
Wives behind, and perhaps not ſo well provided, or taken care for as they ought to be. Theſe Men pretend it is Buſineſs of Honour and Profit, that calls them away; and Experience teaches us, they often under theſe Pretences ruin there Fortunes, and many times hazard what is of more value than their Eſtates, to wit, their Reputation, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Marry to live as Wives, not VVi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and he that puts the contrary upon them, knows not his Duty.</p>
            <p>A Widow talking one day with a Gentleman, ſaid to him; <hi>Sir, I was never Marryed, then do you conſider how it is poſſible for me to be a Widow.</hi> He replyed, Certainly ſhe was ſo, for he had been well acquainted with ſuch a Gentleman who was her Husband. And ſhe returned; <hi>Sir I tell you I was Marryed by Proxy, I was a Wife by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that is no Married Life.</hi> And it was really ſo, for her Husband was ſo continually abſent, ſhe ſcarce knew him.</p>
            <p>If we were in private, I would tell you a Story of a young Man, which I heard at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> There was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman there newly Married his Name
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108575:97"/>
               <hi>Moſen Gralha.</hi> VVhen the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. went into <hi>Italy,</hi> this Youth followed him, contrary to the will of his VVife, who was Young, Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Virtuous. The Husband being in Service, and hoping for Preferment, thought not of returning Home in haſte. The VVife grew weary of waiting, and often writ to him to come home, but at laſt deſpairing of his coming, ſhe ſent him theſe VVords in VVriting, in the <hi>Catalonian</hi> Language; <hi>Moſen Gral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha, Moſen Gralha, Mon Amor non manha Palha:</hi> that is, <hi>Moſen Gralha, Moſen Gralha,</hi> my Love will not feed on Hay. The Husband took the Letter, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed it to the Emperor to interpret for him; who underſtanding it, as well he might, honoured and prefered the Husband, commended the Freedom and diſcretion of the VVoman, and ſent him Home. Monaſteries, Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Precautions that Men make uſe of, to ſecure their VVifes, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous, and without Occaſions be very preſſing, it is an Impoſition to treat Women ſo, and a breach of Faith to leave them; for if any of them had a mind to be a Nun, ſhe would not
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:108575:97"/>
Marry. Every married Man ought to be very cautious, how he abſents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from Home for a long time, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do it, unleſs upon a ſure and very great Advantage. It has been a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute among Politicians, Whether it were expedient to employ Married Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in an Army, or not? Did I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Kings, I would adviſe them, to employ Batchellors in Conqueſts and Offenſive Wars; becauſe, being Single, they expoſe themſelves more freely, are more forward, in hopes to return Home with Honour, and get Wives; and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Living or Dead, they are a leſs Charge to their Soveraign. On the contrary, at Home in a Defenſive War, I would have them prefer Married Men before Batchellors in Military Poſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Men generally are more deſperate in defence of their Wives, Children and Honour, than of their Life. The ſame Advice I give Kings, in reſpect of their Subjects, will ſerve their Subjects in reſpect of their Kings: the one may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it in Chooſing, the others in Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing. But you will not bear with this; for I was running into Politicks and Matters of State, without thinking
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:108575:98"/>
of it. With your leave, I will turn back, and come to my own Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>It is an unſufferable thing in my Ears, to hear ſome Men, who always name their Wife by a Metaphor, or rather Nick-name them, calling them, <hi>My Old Woman, my Bedfellow, my Miſtreſs, my Inſeparable, the Mother of my Children,</hi> and many ſuch Expreſſions, ſome much worſe; but the beſt very unbecoming, and in my opinion, very unworthy any Man of Senſe and Diſcretion. If a Man values his Wife, and ſhe her Husband, Why ſhould they not call one another by the proper Names? for the ſame that is ſaid in reſpect of the one, is to be applyed to the other. Relations that Marry, uſe to call one another by the degree of Kindred that is between them. I love Truth, and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade every body, rather to ſay my Wife, or my Husband, than my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, or my Nephew, or my Niece, or my Uncle: Yet this might be more tollerable, if not carryed ſo far as to give occaſion to what happened to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who continually called his Wife Coſin; for a Servant having occaſion to write to her, ſuperſcribed his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:108575:98"/>
               <hi>To my Maſter's Coſin,</hi> not knowing her Name. <q>(The reaſon of this is, that the Wives in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> do not take the Name of their Husbands, but always retain their own.</q>)</p>
            <p>If I may be allowed to go through with all my Impertinence, I would ſay one word concerning the manner of ſpeaking between Married People. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> word <hi>Tu,</hi> that is, <hi>Thou,</hi> tho' looked upon by them as kind and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, is too vulgar a Word, and if ever, ought only to be uſed in private. The <hi>French vous,</hi> is an Expreſſion they would uſe to the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> were ſhe to come again. It is decent and ſeemly ſometimes, to ſpeak in the Third Perſon. Lordſhip and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency muſt be left to them it belongs to, but it looks ſhie for a Man to Treat his Wife as if ſhe were not ſuch. High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Majeſty may paſs among Kings and Princes, who are forbid thoſe familiar Endearments common to all the reſt of Mankind; which gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to King <hi>John</hi> II. to ſay, <hi>He wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he could be a Man but for three days.</hi> Let me perſwade Married People to treat one another in ſuch Language, as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:108575:99"/>
may beſt expreſs their Love, and ſhew their Reſpect, which is very neceſſary to thoſe who deſire to preſerve Peace and Reputation. But the younger ſort may be diſpenſed with, in the ſtrict Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of any Rules.</p>
            <p>I have not ſaid any thing to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men a long while, and have one thing to recommend to them, which they have no reaſon to make ſlight of, for it is very convenient. There are ſome who revenge the Diſpleaſures they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and cannot remedy on themſelves an Action very indiſcreet and unjuſt. Some, becauſe they have unkind Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, neglect and disfigure themſelves, which makes them ſtill the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Thoſe whoſe Children die, or who bear none, do not only inwardly Afflict themſelves, but expreſs their Trouble in their Cloaths and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which Troubles and Diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes loving Husbands, who have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for them; and furniſhes at leaſt a plauſible Excuſe, for thoſe who value them not, the leſs to regard them. This Diſorder cauſes many great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, which may much diſturb the Peace of a Family; for generally
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:108575:99"/>
Men are not of the Humour of a Friend of mine, who in the like caſe uſed to ſay to his Wife, <hi>Madam, be ſatisfied, that whatſoever you can do to me, I will not love you leſs, nor ſhall you appear the worſe in my Eyes.</hi> That mutual Faith and Equality which is contracted in Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, requires each ſhould indeavour to ſatisfy and pleaſe the other; and as it is a great Grief to the Survivor when either dies, ſo is it a Trouble and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the other, when either is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy or Diſſatisfied. I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid, the Souls of Man and Wife are in common between them, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently their Pleaſures and Sorrows. Let neither Party take upon them, what belongs to the other. Let neither Grieve nor Rejoice, farther than the ſame Paſſion may affect the other.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned thoſe, that for Grief are careleſs of themſelves, it is not amiſs to remember the others, who are as much to blame for their Gaiety, and exceſſive Care in ſetting themſelves out. I have ſpoke of fine Cloaths and Dreſſing, and I know not whether it was Loathing, Anger or Forgetfulneſs, that has kept me from thoſe who Paint their Faces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:108575:100"/>The Woman that lays Paint upon her Face, lays on her own Infamy, and lays aſide her Shame; She adds no Youth or Beauty, but wrongs her Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, her Age, and her Countenance. Every one who ſees it, concludes ſhe has little of her own to truſt to, that has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſuch baſe Borrowed-Helps. He was always eſteemed a Coward, who wore moſt Armour. How many Women, inſtead of Pleaſing by theſe means, Scandalize their Beholders, and provoke to Laughter and Scorn thoſe very People whoſe Admiration they expected to raiſe, and whoſe Affections perhaps, they hoped to gain. This is an abuſe a Husband ought carefully to take away at the very firſt; for Time or Age does not correct, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it. I am of opinion, the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that permits it, has as little Senſe as the Woman that uſes it. One of theſe Women deſiring her Husband to ſit near her; he Anſwered, <hi>Let me alone, for ſince my laſt Sickneſs, I have an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to all Apothecaries Drugs:</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſed to ſay of his Aunt, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very Old, laboured to hide the Signs of Age in her Face; <hi>My Aunt will not
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:108575:100"/>
Credit, nor have others believe Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration:</hi> And in truth it is ſo; for no Art will put the grace of Youth on an Old Face, and it takes away the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. The Faces are disfigured with the continual plague of Waſhes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matums, and the wretched Women are Slaves to their Pride. This is the reaſon another ingeniouſly enough, ſaid, <hi>Such a Lady made an unhappy Slave of her Face:</hi> But Cardinal <hi>Capata</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it more wittily than all of them, who Viſiting an Antient <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, very much addicted to this Beaſtly Cuſtom; She asked, <hi>What News in Italy?</hi> and he perceiving her Face all daubed, anſwered, <hi>Madam, there is very bad News; for as the Caſe ſtands, I find</hi> Soliman <hi>has taken Poſſeſſion of</hi> Civita Vecchia. <q>
                  <hi>Soliman</hi> in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> is <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> much uſed in thoſe ſort of White-Waſhes, to which he alluded; and by <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> is plainly expreſſed her Age; Criticks will call this but a Quibble, or Pun, but ſometimes thoſe paſs for VVit in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and they are generally ſo in other Languages.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I remember but very few years ſince, Painting and Patching were the two

diſtinctive Marks of a Proſtitute in <hi>England;</hi> ſome VVomen of the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Rank, coveting to be known as ſuch, firſt made it faſhionable; and now it is become ſo general a Uſe, it is dangerous to ſpeak againſt it. My Author being a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> doubted not to exclaim againſt it as a Vice in that Country, where it had been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed time out of mind, and where no VVoman thinks her ſelf Dreſſed, till ſhe has hid her Face under a White and Red Mask. Nor will I fear to ſay, it is the greateſt Folly and Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lewdneſs here, where it is a new Invention, and where there are Thouſands of the moſt Beautiful and Vertuous, that will no way be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at me. Experience teaches, how Yellow, how Withered, how Wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled, and how Hagged, a young Face ſoon becomes, with the uſe of theſe curſed Paſtes, VVaſhes, and Colours. he who ſees a Woman that uſes them, riſe out of Bed in a Morning, needs no more to make him loath them; and they, if they had any Senſe, would abhor them. In an Old VVoman, it is no better than Daubing a rotten
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:108575:101"/>
Poſt, the VVorm eats through, it moulders away, and Age and Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction appears through all the Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. But to paſs by the Damage done to the Face; there can be no greater Folly, in regard Nature has given the Complexion, and no Art can mend it; for the worſt Complexion is better than the beſt Counterfeit; nor is any Man ſo blind, as not to ſee thro' a little Tincture of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool, and a Varniſh of <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Ceruſe,</hi> and ſuch like Ingredients. Yet, what makes moſt to our purpoſe, is, that Married VVomen can have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to it, becauſe the Husband muſt ſee them at Night and Morning in all the Deformity it leaves, which muſt cauſe Horror to him; and if they lay it on to pleaſe, it muſt be ſome other Man: for no Husband can be delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſee that aſſume the Shape of an Angel, which he knows in it ſelf, to be a Devil. The Man that bears with ſuch an Impoſition, is certainly paſt all Pity, and deſerves to be made the publick Scorn; and the VVife that practiſes ſo baſe and open a Cheat, to be reputed Infamous, tho' in reality
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:108575:102"/>
ſhe were not ſo. There is another new Invention, which is, VVomen lying with Vizards on their Faces, to preſerve them, it is a ſign they keep them not for their Husbands, and that they who permit it, are not worthy of them. May all ſuch have the Honour to ſee their Wives Cuckold them bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, ſince they never enjoy them but under a Mask. But enough of this; the very Diſcourſe of it is Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. I will only ask of the Ladies, who think they are never Beautiful unleſs their Faces be half covered with Patches, Whether if God had ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe very Spots they put on, ſhould be naturally imprinted in their Skins, they would not think themſelves very unhappy in that Deformity? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they would; and all their Study would be, how to hide it. How ſtrange is it then, that what from the Hand of God would be accounted a Defect, put on by their own, ſhould be miſtaken for Ornament! I cannot think, that Patches add any other Beauty, than to make a VVoman look like a motley Dog; for I am loth to name the Female.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:108575:102"/>Now becauſe theſe Counſels may reach ſome Perſons of high Birth and Quality, who often arrive to great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments Civil or Military; it will not be amiſs to give a little Advice to thoſe Ladies, who may be the Wives of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State, and ſuch as have the Adminiſtration of publick Affairs, for their better behaving themſelves in thoſe Elevated Stations. Many Wives of great Miniſters, to the evident dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their Husbands and Families, take upon them to Manage publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs as well as they. The inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies ariſing from this practice may be reduced to three heads. Interceding for ſuch as have Suits to prefer, deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thoſe that have ſucceeded, and revealing of Secrets to them that ſollicit. I know not which of theſe is worſt. But it is all diſtructive to the Reputation of thoſe Miniſters, whoſe Wives are led away by Flattery, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, or Ambition. I have by me the Copy of a Letter of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, to King <hi>Philip</hi> his Son, when he left him to Govern in his abſence; wherein he informs him what Miniſters he had left him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:108575:103"/>
with, and coming to ſpeak of one he did not thoroughly like, he has theſe Words: Such a Man were the beſt of all, if he were an Eunuch, for the Wife deſtroys in that Man the beſt parts I ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>This fault is of more dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in the Wives of Miniſters of Juſtice, as Judges, and the like. But the Miniſters of State being Perſons of more Note, it is more viſible in them, or perhaps it is not ſo much taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in the former, as more uſual. It was well ſaid of a Courtier to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, who when the Houſe of a Judge who was not very nice had taken Fire, went crying along the Streets: <hi>Help Gentlemen, or our Goods will be Burnt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One who had a Law Suit depending, complain'd to another that the Judge having no Fortune, ſpent like a Man of a great Eſtate, and concluded ſaying, <hi>And whence can all this come;</hi> the other anſwered, <hi>From what is carry'd in:</hi> The former again reply'd, <hi>Sir his Forefathers did not ſo;</hi> and the other return'd, <hi>No, Sir, it is we that are here, who do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:108575:103"/>The Wives of ſome Miniſters often haſten their Husbands ruin, ſtill bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening them with their Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, when they ought to endeavour to eaſe them, and thus they both fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The Husband muſt look to, and keep a watchful Eye to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And ſince it is certain, that we let the Blood out of our Veins, if it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts leſt it inſect the reſt: how much more ought we to drain Ambition and Covetouſneſs from a Wife, if ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear guilty of it? for this threatneth ſudden Sickneſs to the Body and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Death to the Employment and Honour. I grant it might be Lawful for a Wife to recommend, or even fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſome Man's Buſineſs wherein Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice were viſible, putting her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in mind, and giving him ſome hints of it. But theſe things being in themſelves hazardous, it ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens they are carry'd no farther than they ought to be. I could wiſh the puniſhment of the fault were to light only upon the Author of it; but it falls not out ſo, for the Husband is always liable to ſuffer for the indiſcretion of his Wife.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:108575:104"/>There was one of this ſort of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in <hi>Spain,</hi> of no ſqueamiſh Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, his Wife drove the Bargains, and came off always a gainer; he always ſaid when any Body praiſed his Goods, many thanks to my Wives Induſtry. And it was very certain, the effects of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry were viſible enough.</p>
            <p>A Merchant going for <hi>India,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to carry a Preſent for the Wife of a great Miniſter, the poor Man had the ill Fortune to be Shipwrackt, and loſt that and all he had of his own. He return'd to <hi>Spain,</hi> and to Court, and was ſo unjuſtly Treated, that without any regard to his loſs, they oblig'd him to Refund the full value of the Preſent or Venture. Going thence to <hi>Sevil,</hi> he met a Merchant his Friend, and ask'd whether he went, the other ſaid, <hi>To the great Church, to enſure Merchandize of value he expected, with God, and ſome Men of Buſineſs;</hi> then the firſt reply'd; <hi>Sir, let me adviſe you not to do ſo, it is better recommend it to ſuch a Lady, and ſhe will ſecure it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe I hinted ſomething touching Womens revealing the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their Husbands Employments,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:108575:104"/>
it will be ſeaſonable to ſpeak a word of it here, being a circumſtance on which the happineſs of Matrimony has great dependance. I have heard it much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and argued it my ſelf, whether it is fit to diſcover all Secrets to a Wife. I, who always admired a ſincere Love, a long time believed a Virtuous Wife was to be the Cloſet to keep the moſt hidden Secrets of the Husband, and that it was one of the greateſt Bleſſings of Matrimony, that a Man poſſeſſed in a Wife, a faithful Soul, on whom he might unburden his cares and troubles, (which ſometimes overpreſs him) with the ſame ſecurity, as if he had never parted with them out of his own Breſt, and I thought all Love which was not ſo open, was deceitful. This was once my Opinion, but is not at preſent, nor will I give ſuch advice to any Friend of mine; for Experience gained by Years, and precedents has taught me, that he rather is unjuſt to the Love he owes to his Wife, who truſts her with Secrets above her Capacity. This is juſt like Building a great Houſe upon a weak Foundation, which the firſt guſt of Wind throws down. If we put into
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:108575:105"/>
a Boat the Loading of a Ship, it will ſink. The Secrets that were made for great Souls, muſt be kept there; and let us always remember that notable Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Wiſe Man, I never repented for what I did not ſay. Yet ſince I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſalve up all Sores, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I do not look upon Women as wholly unworthy to be entruſted with ſome matters of moment. Therefore if we muſt preſcribe how far this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing, or concealing of Secrets may extend, my Opinion is, That our own private Concerns are fit to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with him. Points of Honour, the Myſteries of our Employ, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Kings, and Affairs of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are never to be let ſlip out of the Husbands Breaſt. Yet if I may aſſign Rules, this is yet a better. To tell a Woman thoſe things ſhe may forward or help with her Induſtry or Counſel, and ſay nothing to her of what is above her reach. I grant there have been, and may be Women in the World of great Souls, fit to be truſted with every thing; but theſe are only Prodigies fram'd by the ſurplus of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing Nature, and we muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:108575:105"/>
ſhe has communicated thoſe Gifts to all, and can ſcarce believe ſhe did to any.</p>
            <p>One of the caſes wherein Marry'd Men have moſt need of Counſel, is to Marry their Children, and it will not be fit that I, who have remembred ſo many trifles, ſhould forget a thing of ſuch conſequence. It is a common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Opinion, that the beſt time to Marry Children, is when the beſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offers. This Rule in my Judgment is very uncertain; for in caſe there be a good opportunity of a Match, and a bad diſpoſition of the Parties, then the goodneſs of the event would be doubtful, or rather ſucceſs would not be hoped. But that Rule is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of an opportunity that follows a diſpoſition, and that Children are inclin'd to that ſtate of Life. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it might be hoped from the conveniencies of a Match, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages it brought might make it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and pleaſing, yet the Will, which is the chief Actor here, is ſeldom Govern'd by thoſe Rules; and it is in vain to expect any ſatisfaction or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of a Marriage that is againſt Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:108575:106"/>
Let Sons be free in their choice; yet in ſuch manner, that their Parents ſtill endeavour to encline them to what is for their Advantage. Fathers in this caſe muſt adviſe, not command. In Daughters the danger is very great, becauſe the vanity of Man has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an inhuman Cuſtom, oppoſite to Honour, Virtue and good Parts, and only in favour of Intereſt: whereby it often happens, that in great and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſes where there are many Daughters, there is ſcarce Portion enough to Marry one of them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her Quality. By this means the reſt are condemn'd to loſe their Liberty by force, and take upon them a courſe of Life they have no manner of Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, but by compulſion is put upon them. This evil is ſcarce to be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, for it would be firſt neceſſary to redreſs the whole Commonwealth, and correct its ill Cuſtoms. If we would Govern our ſelves by Examples of our Forefathers, we have ſeen many great Men who had ſeveral Daughters have increaſed their Families, without putting any thing upon them contrary to their Wills. I think in this caſe, he
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:108575:106"/>
that has many Daughters, might be ſatisfied not to fall, though he did not riſe; which in plain Terms is to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their Daughters to Men, that would ſue for them to Honour their Houſes; and not to endeavour to find ſuch Sons as ſhould add Honour to them. It is enough that the Son-in Law be not Diſhonourable. This is no general Rule, nor do I perſwade any Body not to ſeek what is beſt, I only adviſe Men to conform to neceſſity. I could name many Perſons of great Note, who have obſerv'd this method, and even deſcended to Inferiors, which were thought at firſt ſcandalous, and yet time and Fortune at length made them all equal. The favour of Princes, great Riches, extraordinary merit either in Warfare or Learning, make Men (whoſe original is not infamous) fit to Match with Perſons of the greateſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. A great Man in a few words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed all that is to be ſaid in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his words were, <hi>That Parents to Marry their Sons well, ought to offer and Court for them; but to Marry their Daughters, ſhould be intreated and Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And another no leſs Ingenious ſaid,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:108575:107"/>
               <hi>That good Parts were the ſteps that lead to Quality; for that often Men of ſmall Note, by them roſe to be equal with the greateſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot forbear putting in one Word here for ſome Parents, who turn their Daughters looſe to get Husbands, eſpecially thoſe that have any Charms of Beauty, and herein exceed the bounds of Decency. I confeſs in this particular, I am of a moſt rigid nature; and therefore were I to judge of it by my own Inclinations, I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſufficiently exclaim againſt it. But this Practice is grown ſo Familiar, it appears not near ſo odious to us, as it has done to others. This is ſo received a Cuſtom out of <hi>Spain</hi> (eſpecially in <hi>Flanders</hi>) that Courtſhip is openly managed by aſſignation, nay it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſo far, that Parents inſtruct their Daughters how to manage their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, to gain them for Husbands. Though much againſt my Inclination, I will allow it Lawful to wink at a Daughter when ſhe is Courted by one who will make a fit Husband for her. Yet the manner of this convenience ought to be ſuch, that I look upon it as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:108575:107"/>
impoſſible to manage it right. Let every one in this caſe, conſult his Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
            <p>To this place belongs what we call Marrying by ſtealth, and without the Parents conſent. This may happen two Ways, actively, or paſſively; actively, when the Son Marries, paſſively when the Daughter. I would adviſe a Man whoſe Son Marries well, but without the conſent of the Wives Parents, to bear with it, underhand to aſſiſt them, and not to ſeem openly to countenance or diſavow that Action of his Son. In this caſe I would adviſe a Man for a while to withdraw, or retire into the Country, which is a good expedient to conceal his Joy or Grief, when it is not fit to make either publick. And if this be done before the thing is known, it is the better. I would adviſe the Man whoſe Daughter is Marryed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent, provided the Match be not ſcandalous, to go to her, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Anger for her Diſobedience; which in many Men is rather Rage and Obſtinacy, than true Concern. This perverſneſs between the Parents of thoſe ſo Married, breeds Enmity, Strife
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:108575:108"/>
Quarrels, Slanders, Reflections and Scandal; they rip up Pedigrees, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Secrets, and defame each other; and after laying all their faults open to the World, they become Freinds. When Children Marry well, they are in ſome meaſure excuſable for doing it without their Parents conſent, who ought to be conſenting to all that is for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Children. In fine, it were well every thing were carryed in its proper courſe; but as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb ſays, So the Miracle be wrought, what matter is it if the Devil does it. To Marry ill and againſt the Parents will too, is the greateſt miſcarriage, and moſt generally happens. All the remedy is to make the beſt of it, for the fault cannot be undone. To prevent this, let Parents endeavour in time to provide for their Children, or at leaſt, if it cannot be done as ſoon as deſired, let the munderſtand, Proviſion is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for them. This Hope will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Men who only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not part with anything they have, but keep their Family toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cannot endure to hear of Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:108575:108"/>
their Children; and ſome Women, who rather than ſee a Daughter-in-Law dreſſed up gay by them, or their own Daughter out of their power, and for fear of becoming Grandmothers too, ſoon refuſe good Matches, which often are ſo nice that once rejected they are not eaſily found again. Let a diſcreet Husband and virtuous Wife have a care of this dangerous fault, let them deſire that for their Children when they are Parents, they would have deſired for themſelves at their Age.</p>
            <p>I have ſtretched this diſcourſe to a great length, and it grows tedious, and I could wiſh every point I ſpeak to were the laſt; yet with your leave, I will not break off without one word concerning Fathers and Mothers-in-Law, Sons and Daughters-in-Law, and Brothers and Siſters-in-Law. This is generally an awkward ſort of Kindred. I have many times conſidered and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with my ſelf, what ſhould be the cauſe of this diſcord between them, and can find none but that which the Grand Politician gave upon a different occaſion, ſaying, <hi>That obligations were acceptable to great Men, as long as it was
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:108575:109"/>
in their power to requite them; but when they grew above Recompence, inſtead of Love, they produced Hatred.</hi> I am of Opinion, the Duty between Fathers and Sons-in-Law, and the Love that ought to be between ſuch near Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as Brothers in-Law is ſo great, that not being able to pay it, they convert it into Hatred. The Affection that is due among them plainly appears, in that they call one another, Father, Son, and Brother. This ſufficiently expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes how great the tye is between them, and yet we daily ſee how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their averſion is.</p>
            <p>A Widow Lady complain'd of the great Friendſhip that was between a certain Gentleman and her Son, to whom ſhe thought it not advantageous, and was therefore much diſguſted. A Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant came running to ask what ſhe would give him for the good News he brought; and being ask'd what it was, reply'd, <hi>That my Maſter is fallen out with ſuch a Gentleman, for he is to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his Daughter.</hi> Since I did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to give the reaſon, why it is, I will only endeavour to preſcribe a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to prevent the practice of this
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:108575:109"/>
abuſe. Anſwer me to this: If a Man with great coſt ſhould Build a ſtately Houſe, ſpend many Years in perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, employ his time and Eſtate in making it compleat, and after all ſhould make you a Preſent of this Houſe, and annex a Fortune to it, what would you do? Nay what would the moſt Ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man upon Earth do? Would he not reſpect Love, Cheriſh, and be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to that Perſon? Would he not own himſelf his Servant, his Debtor, and his perpetual Friend? Does he do leſs, or does not he deſerve more: Who for ſeveral Years Breeds up a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Maintains, Inſtructs and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhes her, then ſhares his Fortune with her, and then puts half his Soul, and all this Treaſure into a Man's poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, to whom perhaps he ow'd no obligation.</p>
            <p>I will give you an Inſtance of a good Father-in-Law, for an Example to others, and this happen'd in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and our time. A Rich Man had Marry'd one Daughter to a Man of Quality, and deſired to Marry her Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to another no way ſuperior to the firſt. This latter would not Marry
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:108575:110"/>
the Daughter, unleſs he had with her five Thouſand Crowns more than the former; the Father objected it would be an affront to the firſt, to give another more than he had received. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe would not take place, but he was forc'd to condeſcend, but ſo generouſly that the ſame day the Writings were ſign'd and ſeal'd for the latter, he gave five Thouſand Crowns more to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſaying; <hi>He would not have any Body think he valued him leſs than the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have not ſeen, nor heard of a more Gallant, or Generous Action than this. And that it may appear, there are ſome Sons-in-Law who behave themſelves as they ought. I will Relate another paſſage to that purpoſe. Not many Years ſince there was a Perſon very Rich that had only one Maiden Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who was Heireſs to all the Eſtate, her Mother took a fancy to a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of hers, a Man of Quality, but of a mean Fortune. She ſent him word, ſhe was ſo taken with him, ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to beſtow on him the two dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things ſhe had, to wit, her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and her Eſtate; he anſwered, <hi>It
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:108575:110"/>
were unreaſonable he ſhould at once deprive her of all ſhe had, who loved him ſo well, and to whom he was ſo much obliged; that he accepted of the Daughter, upon condition ſhe ſhould give her but half her Fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible, theſe Examples are very eaſy to write, but very hard to practiſe; and it is that I find fault with. In fine, I do my part, proving a good Correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch Relations, is not impoſſible to be found. A Curſe on Intereſt, which is the chief Cauſe it does not always prevail; for generally it happens, the Quarrels between Fathers and Sons in-Law are grounded upon what was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or not given. I look upon Brothers-in-law to be fitteſt for Companions and Friends, when there is any thing of proportion of Quality and Humours between them; and tho' this be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there ought to be ſtill a fair cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence. There muſt be a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made, between ſuch as are really Bad, and ſuch as are only Ignorant: Tho' a Brother-in-Law be not an <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> he ought to be admitted, and the more, that others may not impoſe upon him. But he who is never ſo
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:108575:111"/>
wiſe, and wicked withal, ought to be carefully avoided, if it were only to avoid being thought to have any ſhare in his ill Actions.</p>
            <p>I have heard ſome Cenſured, and know not but I have Railed at them my ſelf, who as ſoon as Married caſt off all their old Friends, and are wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with their VVives Relations. This is no way juſtifiable; and is moſt practiſed by thoſe who are governed by the VVife. A New Married Man always walked between two Brothers-in-Law he had, nor did he ever ſtep aſide from them, or they from him; he often paſſed by one who had been his Friend when a Batchellor, and was very ſtrange to him; he at laſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, told him, <hi>Sir, I am very ſorry your Lady has ſo little Faith in you, that ſhe will not let you walk the Streets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Keepers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not fit we quite paſs by in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, a Diſturbance cauſed by that, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens among Married People, which is Jarrs and Diſcontents, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Scandalous between the Wife and Kindred, whether they be her own or her Husbands. This often proceeds from
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:108575:111"/>
very ſlight Occaſions. Womens Revenge being commonly weak, their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints are the more, which occaſion Miſtruſt and Animoſities, very oppoſite to the Rules of Decency, and dangerous to the Conſcience; for very often, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of Friendſhip, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed an inveterate Malice. Some Men think it great Prudence to have no hand, nor appear in theſe Differences. I do not approve of it, becauſe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the juſtifying, or correcting a Wives Proceedings, belongs to the Husband, as a Superior, but alſo the Directing and Guiding of them, belongs to him chiefly in matter of Friendſhip and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; as the Subjects making Peace or VVar, appertains to the King. In Caſes of ſmall Importance, which are the moſt common, I would allow ſome Connivance; the Reaſon is, when an Arm or Leg is broke or diſlocated, it is abſolutely neceſſary to have recourſe to the Chirurgeon or Bone-Setter; but, when it is only ſome Sore in the Fleſh, it is better let it alone, it will heal it ſelf, and perhaps, the more is apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, the worſe it grows. When the Differences between the Wife and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:108575:112"/>
her Relations run high, and are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being noiſed abroad, and giving Scandal, then the Husband is obliged to interpoſe, and reconcile all. The beſt way to compaſs this, is to Treat with the Husband of that Kinſwoman, if ſhe is Married, Whether ſhe gave, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Provocation: it is good to Reconcile and make them Friends, tho' to compaſs it, a Man were obliged to tell each of them a Lie, ſaying, <hi>It is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the other;</hi> which, to them is a great Satisfaction. Some VVomen, and not a few, are Obſtinate, and in theſe Caſes, will not yield the leaſt Point: However, the Husbands are obliged to bring them to what is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and perſwade them, it is fit they take their Advice, upon whom it lyes, to look to their Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. Yet, if all his Care and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry ſhould fail of Succeſs, I would not adviſe a Man to fall out with his VVife, becauſe ſhe is at Variance with another.</p>
            <p>In fine, Sir, when I began to write to you, my Deſign was not to exceed the Bounds of a Letter, and I have run on to a Volume. I am naturally apt to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:108575:112"/>
be particular, and tedious: Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Solitude, which ſtir up Thought, have made me take in ſo great a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, that it might contain all Caſes, and all Rules. I pray God we have not laboured in vain; which would come to paſs, if you having heard, and I ſaid much, neither of us ſhould reap any Advantage of it. I will conclude with thoſe general Heads, which in my Opinion make up the Grandeur of a Houſe, which ſhall be an Epitome of much that might be ſaid, in relation to each Point.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible, when I ſhall be read by ſome Married People, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by thoſe that are about being ſuch, they will judge this Way, thro' which I pretend to lead them to Quiet and Eaſe, very terrible. For they will ſay, it is ſo covered with the Thorns of Precaution and Circumſpection, that the Theory is difficult, and much more the Practice of it. To this I Anſwer, that this Letter may be compared to the Sea-Carts, which are ſo full of Lines, that thoſe who do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, think it impoſſible ever to unravel that Confuſion: and yet it is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:108575:113"/>
not ſo; for moſt of thoſe Lines are the ſame; the Principal not being above Four, which are ſo often multiplied and repeated, to make the Uſe of the Cart the eaſier. VVhoſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders this variety of Counſels, will find them ſo like, and to have ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion and dependance one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he will not think they are many, but one continued. And becauſe we ſee a Line that is made of a few Threads, if hard drawn, is eaſily broke; therefore it is requiſite to compoſe of many Counſels and Rules this Line, on which hangs the Life, Honour, and Salvation of Married People, that the force of Vice may not break it. And again, becauſe it always breaks in the weakeſt Place, and this is natural to the VVomen, therefore it is neceſſary ſo to ſtrengthen her with Induſtry and Art, that tho' opportunity ſhould draw never ſo hard, ſhe may ſtill remain VVhole and Entire.</p>
            <p>But if after all, this Doctrine ſhould be judged by the VVomen too Rigid and Auſtere, I do aſſure them, I deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not ſo, but rather to direct all things for their Satisfaction, Service,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:108575:113"/>
and Reputation. That this may more manifeſtly appear, let any deſire me to write a Letter of Inſtructions for the Married VVomen, and they ſhall ſee what I ſay in their behalf, if they are not ſatisfied with what I have ſaid to the Husbands.</p>
            <p>Sir, A clean Houſe, a neat Table, decent Diet, Attendance without Noiſe, good Servants, One to direct them, VVages duly paid, a Coach upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a fat Horſe, much Silver, leſs Gold, ſome Jewels, as much Money as may be, all Utenſils, ſtore of Furniture, the beſt of Pictures, ſome Books, a few Arms, a Houſe of your own, a little Country-Houſe, Prayers at Home, much Alms, few Neighbours, Children not pampered, good Order in all things, a Vertuous VVife, and a Chriſtian-like Husband, make Life pleaſant, and Death happy.</p>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:108575:115"/>
Puche,</hi> and pray to God they may enjoy one another many Years. <hi>Moſen Puche</hi> marrying a Wife of Fifteen Years of Age, and <hi>D. Marina Gralla</hi> a Husband of Seventeen, if I am not deceived; they are like to have time enough to enjoy, and even to lament their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. <hi>Solon</hi> adviſed the <hi>Athenians</hi> not to Marry, till they were Twenty Years of Age. The good <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ordered the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> not to Wed, till Twenty five. The Philoſopher <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus,</hi> forbad the <hi>Egyptians</hi> taking Wives before Thirty; and in caſe any preſumed to Marry ſooner, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded they ſhould be publickly Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and their Children reputed Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legitimate. Were <hi>Moſen Puche</hi> and <hi>D. Marina Gralla Egyptians,</hi> as they are of <hi>Valencia,</hi> they would not eſcape be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhed, and their Children diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited. The Kindneſs I received from your Mother, and the Love I bore your Father, when I was Inquiſitor at <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencia,</hi> move me to compaſſionate your being Married ſo Young, and your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo great a Burden upon you; for it is now too late for you, to caſt off the heavy Yoak of Matrimony, and you are
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:108575:115"/>
not of Age to bear it. If your Father Married you, he treated you Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly; and if you Married without his leave, you are guilty of a great Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for it is a raſhneſs in a Youth of Seventeen, and a Girl of Fifteen, to preſume to ſet up Houſe; and it is want of Senſe in others, to be conſenting to it. The poor Young Couple are not ſenſible how heavy a Yoak they take upon them, nor how much Liberty they deprive themſelves of. Let us ſee what Qualifications are requiſite in the Wife, and what in the Husband, to make them happy; and if they are to be found in <hi>Moſen Puche</hi> and <hi>D. Marina Gralla,</hi> I do henceforth approve their Marriage, and own I know not what I ſay. The Properties of a good Wife are, That ſhe carry her ſelf with Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity Abroad, have Wiſdom to govern her Houſe, Patience to bear with her Husband, Tenderneſs to breed her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Courteſy to deal with her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Induſtry to manage her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, that ſhe have much regard to her Honour, love good Company, and be an Enemy to all Youthful Follies. The Properties of a good Husband are,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:108575:116"/>
That he be ſober in Speaking, eaſy in Diſcourſe, faithful where he is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, diſcreet in giving Counſel, careful of providing his Houſe, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in looking after his Eſtate, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in bearing the Importunities of his Wife, zealous of the Education of his Children, vigilant in what relates to his Honour, and very ſtayed in all his Behaviour. Let me ask now, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall find all theſe Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Moſen Puche</hi> at Seventeen, and <hi>D. Marina Gralla</hi> at Fifteen years of Age, or whether ever they ſo much as thought of them? It is much to be feared, that ſuch a Young Couple nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtand theſe nice Points when told them, nor know where to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, when they find themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective. VVell, I do avouch and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, That if <hi>Moſen Puche</hi> now at Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen, and <hi>D. Marina Gralla</hi> at Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years of Age, will not firſt learn, and having learnt, obſerve all theſe Conditions; they will in a little time, lye down under their Burthen of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, or each of them will ſeek out a new Love. I do not believe it any thing ſo dangerous, for a Man to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:108575:116"/>
take upon him the Habit of a Religious Order, as for a Youth to Marry; for the one has time, and may leave it; and the other has not liberty to repent. Of how pernicious conſequence it is, for Seventeen and Fifteen Years of Age to Marry, can be better related by <hi>Moſen Puche</hi> and <hi>D. Marina Gralla,</hi> then writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by me; for whatſoever I ſhall ſay, is but by Gueſs, and they can ſpeak by Experience. The Inconveniences of Marrying too Young are many and great, they are broke by Childbearing, loſe their Strength, are over-burdened with Children, ruine their Fortune, grow Jealous, have not a right ſenſe of Honour, know not how to provide for their Family, grow weary of their firſt Love, and fix their Thoughts elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; ſo that the Fruit of Wedding, when Children is, that they live Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily, or part in their old Age. The Divine <hi>Plato</hi> adviſed thoſe of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, to Marry their Children at ſuch an Age, that they might judge of what they choſe, and underſtand what they took upon them. This is a weighty Sentence of <hi>Plato;</hi> for it is an eaſy thing for any body to chooſe a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:108575:117"/>
Husband or Wife, but it is very hard to govern a Family. I have not been Married, nor ever had any Temptation that way; but by what I have ſeen by my Relations, by what I have read in Books, by what I have gueſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong my Neighbours, and by what I have heard from my Friends, I find that thoſe who happen to Marry well, enjoy a Heaven upon Earth, and thoſe who ſpeed ill, make their Houſe a meer Hell. What Man ever yet met with ſo accompliſhed a Wife, that he miſſed not ſome Perfection in her? What Woman choſe, or light upon ſo poliſhed a Man, that ſhe diſcovered not ſome Blemiſh in him? There is ſcarce any VVedding, but at firſt is pleaſant and agreeable, but in a little time there is nothing more nauſeous, and it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, that as ſoon as the Money grows ſhort, Diſcontents ariſe. O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Husband! for if your VVife be of high Birth, you muſt bear with her Extravagancies: If ſhe be Diſcreet and Meek, you had nothing with her: If ſhe be Rich, you are aſhamed to own her Kindred: If Beautiful, you are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſecure of her: If Deformed, you
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:108575:117"/>
are ſoon weary of her Houſe, and ſhun her Bed: If ſhe is Prudent and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you complain, ſhe is Dainty, and a Rambler: If ſhe is Neat and a great Houſekeeper, on the other ſide, ſhe is ſo ill Natur'd no Servant can endure her: If you are proud, that ſhe is Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and Retired, you hate her for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jealous. What more ſhall I ſay to you, unfortunate Husband? and yet I muſt ſay more; That if you keep your VVife at home, ſhe is eternally Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining; if ſhe has liberty to gadd, ſhe is ſubject to every bodies Cenſure; if you chide often, ſhe is always out of Humour; and if you give her her way, there is no living with her. If ſhe has the command of the Purſe, woe be to your Eſtate; and if you keep it in your own hands, ſhe'll either pick your Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, or ſell your Goods. If you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at home, ſhe thinks you are Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and if you come late, ſhe ſays, you are Debauched. If you allow her good Cloaths, ſhe will go abroad to be ſeen; and if you Cloath her ill, ſhe makes your Meals uneaſy. If you are Fond of her, ſhe undervalues you; and if you are any thing Cold, ſhe ſuſpects
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:108575:118"/>
you love elſewhere. If you do not tell her what ſhe asks, ſhe never ceaſes importuning; and if you reveal a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to her, ſhe cannot keep it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here the reaſon; why, if there be Ten contented Couples in a Town, there are an Hundred that repent, and are weary of their Lives, who would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly be Divorced from their Wives, if the Church were as free to allow it as their Conſciences. If Matrimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians were uſed as among the Gentiles, that every one when he pleaſed, might be Divorced, I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for it, There would be more Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in <hi>Lent</hi> to Unmarry, than there is at <hi>Shrovetide</hi> to Marry.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>That none ſhould Marry, but with their Equals.</head>
               <p>The Rules I deſign to preſcribe here, for thoſe who are about Marrying, or Married, if they are not ſo ſucceſsful as to make them live contentedly, will at leaſt ſerve to prevent many Diſtaſtes. In the firſt place, it is very wholſom Advice, That the Man chooſe ſuch a Wife, and the VVoman ſuch a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:108575:118"/>
as does not exceed them in Birth or Fortune; that is, that Gentry match among Gentry, Merchants among Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, the Yeomanry among Yeoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Farmers among Farmers: for if there be any Inequality, the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or will be diſſatisfied, and the Superior weary of his Life. I do avouch, that the Merchant who Marries his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a Man of Quality, and the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer who contracts his Alliance with a Gentleman, do bring into their Houſe one that will publiſh their Shame, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their Fortune, take away their good Name, and ſhorten their Life. It is an unhappy Marriage, when a Man or VVoman is aſhamed to call their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law <hi>Father,</hi> and the Mother-in-Law <hi>Madam.</hi> In this caſe, I ſay, a Man does not receive a Son-in-Law but a Plague, not a Daughter-in-Law but a Viper, not Children but Adders, not Kindred to reſpect, but to affront them, not Relations to honour, but defame them. In fine, I ſay a Man had better Bury his Daughter, than not Marry her to his Equal; for if ſhe were Dead, he would lament her a Day, but being ill Married, he has cauſe to bewail her
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:108575:119"/>
every day. The rich Merchant, the poor Yeoman, the wiſe Farmer, and the mean Tradeſman, have no need of Daughters-in-Law that know how to Dreſs themſelves, but that have learnt to Spin; for whenſoever they take State upon them, and begin to knot Fringes, the Houſe runs to confuſion, and the Eſtate to ruin. Again, I ſay, theſe ſorts of People muſt be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, how they take a Son-in-Law that values himſelf much upon his Gentility, that is proud of his Horſemanſhip, that affects being a great Courtier, that can do nothing but walk about, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands Cards and Dice; for in this caſe, the poor Father-in-Law muſt pinch, to ſupport the Extravagancies of his Son-in-Law. To conclude, let me adviſe every one to Marry their Equal, or before a Year come about, he that makes a fooliſh Match, will be ſenſible of its pernicious Conſequences. It is alſo convenient, that every one chooſe a Wife agreeable to his Fancy and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; for if the Father marries his Son, or he does it himſelf, for conveniency, and not for love, the unhappy Youth cannot properly ſay, he is Married, but
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:108575:119"/>
for ever Enſlaved. To the end that Marriages may be laſting, loving, and pleaſing, the Hearts ought to be united before the Hands are joined. It is fit the Father adviſe the Son to Marry where he likes; but let him have a care of uſing any Violence, for all forced Matches breed Diſlike betweeen the Young Ones, Differences between the Fathers, Scandal among the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Quarrels among the Relations, and Diſputes among the Brothers. I do not pretend to juſtify a wild Youth marrying raſhly and in private; for Marriages that begin in inconſiderate Love alone, often end in Diſcord. There is nothing more frequently to be ſeen, than a very Young Man who has his full liberty, and knows not what he loves or chooſes, to fall in love with, and Marry a Young Woman; but no ſooner has he ſatisfied his Appetite, than he begins to hate her. Nothing is ſo much to be endeavoured between Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried People, as that they love and eſteem one another, elſe they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be Diſcontented, and their Neighbours will have enough to do to keep the Peace between them. I muſt
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:108575:120"/>
alſo warn them, that to the end their Love be laſting, ſincere and ſecure, it muſt take root in the Heart by degrees; for if it take poſſeſſion furiouſly all at once, it will ſoon quit the Hold. I have ſeen many love in great haſte, who have afterwards hated one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at leiſure. The ſame Advice I give the Father, not to marry his Son againſt his Inclination, the ſame I give the Son not to marry without his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Conſent; for otherwiſe, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Curſe might do him more harm, than he could expect benefit from the Portion his Father-in-Law gives him. Young Men in the heat of Youth, have only regard to their Pleaſure when they Marry, and therefore are ſatisfied if the Wife be Beautiful; but the Father and Mother whoſe Honour and Eſtate lye at ſtake, ſeek a Woman that is Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, Rich, well Temper'd, Modeſt, and of a good Family; the laſt thing they look upon is Beauty. Clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine and private Weddings proceed from Indiſcretion and Diſreſpect; for they give the Neighbours occaſion to cenſure, and the Old Parents to lament. It often happens, that after the Mother
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:108575:120"/>
has ſlaved her ſelf to fix a Houſe, and the Father laboured to make a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they are Treating of ſome honourable Match, they find the wild Youth Married: Thus the Mother is afflicted, the Father ſhamed, the Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred diſappointed, and the Friends ſcandalized. Sometimes the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is yet greater, when the Son has taken ſuch a Wife, that the Father thinks his Eſtate ill beſtowed upon her, and is aſhamed to receive her into his Houſe. There is another Miſchief of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten attends ſuch Marriages, which is, That Parents upon occaſion, propoſe with the Son's Portion to Match a Daughter, and the Young Man's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign being only to enjoy the Woman, and not look after a Fortune, the Siſter is ruined, the Son is cheated, and the Father diſappointed. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Politicks ſays, The <hi>Grecians</hi> uſed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to whip the Son that Married without his Father's Conſent, and that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> diſinherited him. <hi>Laertius</hi> ſays, That among the <hi>Thebans</hi> they were not only Diſinherited, but publickly Curſed by their Parents. Let none ſlight the Bleſſing or Curſe
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:108575:121"/>
of their Elders; for among the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> the Father's Bleſſing was far more eſteemed than the Inheritance.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>That a Wife muſt be very Modeſt, and not laviſh of her Tongue.</head>
               <p>It is wholſom and neceſſary Advice, That a Man who is upon Marrying, chooſe a very modeſt Woman; for, if there were only one Vertue requiſite in a Woman, it muſt be Modeſty. I confeſs, it is worſe for the Conſcience, but affirm, it is much better for a Man's Honour, that a Wife be private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diſhoneſt, than openly Impudent. Modeſty hides many Crimes in a VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and Impudence makes her be ſuſpected of more than ſhe is really guilty of. Let every Man think what he pleaſeth; but I am ſatisfied, there is little to find fault with in a Modeſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and nothing to commend in one that is Impudent. The Arms that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture furniſhed a Woman with, to ſecure her Reputation, Chaſtity, Honour and Fortune, are only her Modeſty; and whenſoever ſhe parts with that, ſhe has loſt all. When a Man is about Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:108575:121"/>
the firſt thing he ought to inquire into, is not Whether ſhe is Rich, but whether ſhe is Modeſt? for a Fortune may be made, but an Impudent VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will never become Modeſt. The beſt Portion, the beſt Eſtate, and the richeſt Jewel a Woman can beſtow oh her Husband, is Modeſty; and if a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſees his Daughter has loſt it, it were a leſs trouble to Bury, than Marry her. The beſt on't is, that ſome VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men pretend to be Wits, to Repartee, to break Jeſts, and Banter; this I would not have them learn, much leſs pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: for that which in a Man is good Humour, in a VVoman is Lightneſs. A Vertuous Woman ſhould not only be aſhamed of ſpeaking light and undecent VVords, but of hearing them. A ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber VVoman muſt not value her ſelf upon being Witty, and having a ſmooth Tongue, but upon being Modeſt and Silent; for if ſhe is proud of Talking and Jeſting, the ſame Men who laugh at her Jeſt, will preſently condemn her Carriage. Womans Reputation is ſo nice, it is not lawful for them to think of many things that Men may act and ſay. Ladies that would keep up a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:108575:122"/>
muſt not only have a care of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering unlawful and undecent Things, but even thoſe that are allowable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs very neceſſary; for a VVoman ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver does ill in being Silent, and ſeldom does well in Talking. Unhappy that Husband, who has a talkative, prating and bold VVife; for if once ſhe ſets upon telling a Story, or framing a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, no Reaſon will be heared, nor no Perſwaſion will ſtop her Mouth. The uneaſy life ſome VVomen lead with their Husbands, is not ſo often cauſed by what they Act, as what they ſay. If when the Huband chides, the VVife would be Silent, their Meals would not for the moſt part be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet; but on the contrary, if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to Mutter, ſhe Scolds, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times draws on Blows, and expoſes them to their Neighbours.</p>

               <head>That a Wife muſt keep Houſe, and not expoſe her ſelf.</head>
               <p>It is wholſom Advice, that a VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be reſerved, and value her ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being a great Houſe-keeper; for when a VVoman becomes too abſolute
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:108575:122"/>
at Home, ſhe is ſoon after diſſolute Abroad. A Vertuous VVoman muſt be very cautious in what ſhe ſays, and circumſpect in all ſhe does; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careleſs of what they ſay, often makes them heedleſs of what they do. There is none ſo ignorant, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands how much more nice the Honour of a Woman is, than that of a Man; which is demonſtrable, in that a Man cannot be diſhonoured but by Reaſon, but the Opportunity is enough to defame a Woman. The Woman that is Vertuous, and values her ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, may be aſſured, ſhe will be ſo much the more Vertuous, by how much the leſs ſhe confides in her ſelf; I mean, by how much the leſs ſhe dares ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to give ear to idle Words, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit feigned Offers. Be ſhe who ſhe will, be ſhe never ſo great, and never ſo conceited, if ſhe affects to be Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and loves to be Complimented, ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or later ſhe will fall into the Snare. If they ſay, all that is only to paſs the time, for Diverſion, and in Jeſt; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That ſuch Jeſts commonly light heavy upon them. I do again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, conjure any Woman of what
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:108575:123"/>
Quality or Degree ſoever, That ſhe truſt not her ſelf, or be too familiar with any Kinſman or Relation; for if ſhe fears what may happen by too much Freedom with a Stranger, ſhe ought to dread what may be ſaid of her with a Kinſman or Relation. Let none rely upon the nearneſs of the Kindred, and think that takes off all Scandal; for if the Malice of Man dare preſume to judge of Thoughts, how much more will it of what is viſible? I would have thoſe Ladies who ſhall hear or read this Letter, obſerve this point, which is, That for a Man it is enough that he be good, tho' he appear not ſuch; but it is not enough for a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be good, unleſs ſhe appear ſo. Obſerve, and obſerve well, That as the Suſtenance of the Family depends on the Husband, ſo the Honour of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the Wife only; for a Houſe has only ſo much Honour, as the Wife has Vertue. She is not an honeſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who has a beautiful Face, a fine Shape, is of great Birth, and manages her Fortune; but ſhe who is very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt in her Behaviour, and very ſparing of her Tongue. <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes, That
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108575:123"/>
the Wife of <hi>Thucydides</hi> the <hi>Grecian,</hi> being asked how ſhe could endure her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Stinking Breath? anſwered, <hi>She thought all Mens Breath had ſmelt ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no other but He ever came near her,</hi> O Example! worthy to be known, and much worthy to be imitated. That Noble <hi>Grecian</hi> teaches us, That a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Woman muſt be ſo reſerved, that no Man may come near enough for her to ſmell his Breath, or for him to touch her Garment.</p>

               <head>That a Wife muſt not be Haughty, nor High Spirited.</head>
               <p>It is alſo wholſom Advice, That a Woman be not High-ſpirited, nor Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, but rather Meek and Patient; for there are two things moſt prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Female Sex, too much Tongue, and too little Patience: hence it follows, That ſhe who is Silent will be reſpected by all Men, and ſhe who is Submiſſive will live happily with her Husband. O how miſerable is the Man that marries a High-ſpirited Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man! for Mount <hi>Etna</hi> does not caſt out ſo much Fire, as ſhe ſpits Venom out
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:108575:124"/>
of her Mouth. The High-ſpirit of a Woman is much more to be dreaded than the Anger of a Man; for a Man in his Paſſion chides, but the VVoman in her Fury chides and bites. A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Man and a modeſt VVoman, muſt never oppoſe a VVoman in her Fury; for when her Paſſion is inflamed, and her Shame laid aſide, ſhe will not only ſay what ſhe has ſeen and heard, but even what ſhe dreamed. It is a pleaſure to me, to ſee a VVoman when ſhe is Enraged and in her Fury, how ſhe neither hears her ſelf, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands others, nor admits of any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, nor will give ear to a VVord, nor take Counſel, nor hearken to Reaſon; and the beſt of all is, that ſhe often leaves them ſhe was quarrelling with, to fall upon thoſe that came to pacify her. VVhen a VVoman quarrels with any body, and another comes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe her, ſhe is ſo far from being thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that ſhe will make it a cauſe of Complaint, and ſay, that had he or ſhe been what ſhe took them for, they would have taken her part, and revenged her. A VVoman that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Furious, never thinks ſhe is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:108575:124"/>
without Cauſe, or chides without Reaſon; and therefore, it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to take no notice of, than contradict her. I repeat it over again, That it is unhappy where the Miſtreſs is given to Strife; for ſhe is always in a readineſs to chide, but never to know her ſelf. A High-ſpirited VVoman is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; for ſhe enrages her Husband, ſcandalizes her Relations, is ill beloved by her Kindred, and the Neighbours fly from her: whence it follows, that ſometimes the Husband forgets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and lays the weight of his hands upon her. In ſome meaſure it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, to hear a paſſionate VVoman ſcold, but it is alſo terrible to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what Expreſſions ſhe will utter; for if ſhe has to do with a multitude, ſhe will not want a Litany of Reproaches. She tells the Husband, he is Negligent; the Men, that they are Lazy; the Maids, ſhe calls Sluts; the Sons, ſhe ſays, are Greedy; the Daughters love Gadding, the Friends are Ingrateful, the Enemies are Perfidious, the Neighbours are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious and Envious; and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, no Man is true to another, or faithful to his VVife. I am a Liar, if I
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:108575:125"/>
did not ſee an honeſt Couple part, only becauſe the unfortunate Man ſometimes was melancholy at Table, and ſighed in Bed: The VVife ſaid, he meditated ſome miſchief to her at Table, and ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſome other VVoman in Bed; and the truth was, the poor Man was Security for another in a deſperate Caſe, and could not enjoy himſelf. At length, after much preaching, intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and chiding, I could never recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them, till he took an Oath before me, never more to be ſad at Table or ſigh in Bed. The VVoman that is Meek and Peaceable, will be happy with her Husband, well attended by her Servants, reſpected by her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and honoured by her Relations; if otherwiſe, ſhe may be aſſured, all will fly her Houſe, and bleſs themſelves at her Tongue. VVhen a VVoman is Haughry and Furious, it is no ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Husband tho' ſhe be Nobly deſcended, Beautiful, Rich, and a good Houſewife; he rather curſes the Day on which he Married, and damns him that firſt mentioned her to him.</p>

               <head>That the Husband is not to be too Severe, eſpecially when newly Married.</head>
               <p>It is alſo wholſom Advice, That the Husband carry not himſelf haughty and uneaſily towards his Wife; for there will never be any Peace among them, if the Wife does not learn to be Silent, and the Husband cannot be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. I dare boldly ſay, and almoſt ſwear, it is rather a Houſe of Mad than Married People, in which the Husband wants Diſcretion and the Wife Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for ſuch a Couple muſt either part, or come to Blows. Women are naturally weak and eaſy, therefore a Man ought to bear with their Faults, and conceal their Infirmities, in ſuch manner they muſt ſooth an hundred times, to one that they bite. If the Man is to be pitied who has a haughty hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor'd Wife, much more the Woman who has a ſtern Husband; for ſome of them are ſo Outragious and Paſſionate, that no Woman can have Art enough to pleaſe them, nor Patience enough to endure them. It is impoſſible, but there muſt be ſome Diſtaſtes between a
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:108575:126"/>
Man and his Wife, either upon account of the Children or Servants, or for want of Money; then is the time for a Man to ſhew his Wiſdom, when the Wife is Angry, either paſſing it off with a Jeſt, or taking no Notice. If a Man were obliged to anſwer, and ſatisfy all Points, whereat a Wife is concerned, and whereof ſhe complaineth, there is no doubt, he will need the ſtrength of <hi>Samſon</hi> and the VViſdom of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Obſerve, O Husband! what I ſay to you, either you have a diſcreet or a mad VVife: If you have a mad VVife, it is to no purpoſe to admoniſh her; and if you have a wiſe Wife, one angry Word is enough; for you may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if a VVoman does not mend upon VVarning, ſhe will never be the better for Threatning. VVhen a VVoman is in the height of her Paſſion, ſhe muſt be born with; and when her Anger is abated, ſhe is to be checked: for if once ſhe forgets the Reſpect is due to her Husband, there will be nothing but Noiſe and Confuſion between them. A diſcreet Man and good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, muſt rather manage his Wife with Art, than down-right Force and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:108575:126"/>
Violence; for the Nature of Woman is ſuch, that tho' ſhe have been Thirty years Married, he will ſtill find out ſomething new in her to correct, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. It is alſo worth obſerving, that if a Man at all times ought to avoid ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Diſguſts with his Wife, it ought to be much more when they are newly Married, for, if at firſt the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man takes an Averſion to him, ſhe will ſcarce ever love him after. A diſcreet Husband at firſt, muſt ſooth, cheriſh, and by all means, ſtrive to gain the love of his Wife: for if they love at firſt, all their Quarrels afterwards will be the effect of ſudden Paſſion, not preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate Malice. Love and Hatred are mortal Enemies; which ſoever firſt takes poſſeſſion of the Heart, makes his abode there for Life; ſo that the firſt love may be removed, but never forgot. If when firſt Married, a Woman begins to hate her Husband, I engage ſhe'll have a miſerable Life, and he a weary Youth, and diſconſolate Old Age; for though he may make himſelf be feared, he ſhall never prevail to be beloved. Many Husbands value themſelves upon being feared, and waited on in their Houſes; I rather pity than envy them:
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:108575:127"/>
for the Woman that leads an uneaſy Life, fears and attends her Husband; but ſhe that is contented, loves, and pleaſes him. The Wife muſt do any thing to be in her Husbands favour, and the Husband muſt be cautious how he incurs the diſpleaſure of his Wife; for if ſhe reſolves to love another, he ſhall enjoy her in deſpight of her Husband. For, ſo tedious a Journey, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom a Life as Matrimony, it is not enough the Husband robs the Wife of her Virginity, it is requiſit he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe her Affection: for it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that they are Married, unleſs they be happy in each other, and live very contentedly. If a Husband is not beloved by his Wife, his Eſtate is not ſafe, his Houſe is uneaſy, his Honour in danger, and even his Life not ſecure; for it is to be believed, ſhe will not wiſh him to live long, with whom her Life is Unhappy.</p>

               <head>That Husbands muſt not be over-Jealous.</head>
               <p>It is alſo wholeſom Advice, that Husbands have a care of being ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of their Neighbours and extreamly Jealous of their Wives; for there are
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:108575:127"/>
only two ſorts of People very ſubject to Jealouſy; to wit, thoſe who are very ill-natured, and thoſe who in their Youth were very debauched. Theſe believe, that whatſoever they did with other Mens VVives, their VVives will do with other Men; and it is Folly to think, and Madneſs to ſay ſo; for though ſome Women be lewd, there are others very virtuous. To ſay all Women are good, is too much partiality, and to ſay they are all bad, is extravagant; it is enough to ſay, that among Men there is much to condemn, and among Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men much to commend. I do not deny but that an eaſy and looſe Woman muſt not only be checked, but alſo be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of opportunities of doing ill; yet it is to be ſuppoſed ſhe muſt not on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſecurity be ſo immured, and ill treated, as to make her deſperate. It can not be denied, that there are ſome Women ſo perverſe and lewd, that they are not to be reclaimed by Fear, nor mended by Puniſhment, but rather ſeem born only to be a Plague to their Husbands, and a Scandal to their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. On the other ſide, there are very many Women ſo ſweetly tempered, and ſo chaſte, that they ſeem created
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:108575:128"/>
for the Honour of their Country and Glory of their Kindred. I cannot but ſay over again, It is not amiſs ſometimes to keep a Wife within, to look to her, and debar her any company that is ſuſpicious; but this muſt be done with ſuch Art that ſtill more confidence may appear to be repoſed in her goodneſs, than in all his own Precautions. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Men for being Cautious, but do no way approve of their being Jealous, for naturally Women covet nothing ſo much, as what is moſt forbidden them. If the Husband ſuſpects his Wife, he muſt uſe Art, and not betray himſelf by Words; for if a Woman once finds ſhe is wronged and miſtruſted, ſhe will find out way to verify the Suſpicion, not ſo much out of any Inclination to vice, as the deſire of revenge. The Strength of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the Knowledge of <hi>Homer,</hi> the Prudence of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> the Cunning of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> the Patience of <hi>Job,</hi> the Subtility of <hi>Hannibal</hi> and the VVatchfulneſs of <hi>Hermogenes</hi> are not ſufficient to govern and entirely ſubdue a VVoman; for there is no skill or force in the World can make her good, againſt her VVill. It is not prudence in a Man to reveal, or preſently to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:108575:128"/>
the Frailties and Failings of his VVife; ſome he muſt Check, ſome he muſt Chaſtiſe, ſome he muſt Correct ſome he muſt Prevent, and the moſt he muſt Wink at. Though a VVoman be never ſo diſcreet and patient, there are two things ſhe hates to hear, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to endure; which are, to be eſteemed unchaſt, or ugly; for though ſhe be lewd, ſhe would be thought virtuous, and though ugly, deſires to be counted Beautiful. To conclude, when the Husband is ſatisfied as to all Points, that is, that his VVife does not expoſe her Perſon, that ſhe does not defile his good Name, and that ſhe does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his Eſtate, then I am of Opinion he muſt not diſcover any marks of Jealouſy or Suſpition; for a VVoman's Obligation to be virtuous is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when a Husband repoſes much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in her.</p>

among them, that no knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may reach their Neighbours; for if the love them not, they will be pleaſed therewith; and if they Love them, they will have ſomething to cenſure. Some Men have ſo little Conſideration, and ſome VVomen ſo little Patience, that the former can not Chide without loud Scolding, nor the latter Anſwer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Shrieking, ſo that their Neighbours have enough to do to Pacify them all the VVeek, and hear their Complaints on Sunday. The Husband complains his VVife is ſo High ſpirited, the Devil can not bear with her. He complains, ſhe is miſtruſtful and jealous to ſuch a degree, he can not live with her. He complains ſhe is paſſionate and ſoul-mouth'd, and is always abuſing him. He complains, ſhe is weakly, ugly, and ſickly, and that all he has is ſpent in looking after her. He complains, ſhe is nice, dainty and lazy, and never riſes till Noon. He complains, ſhe is naſty, a ſlattern, and heedleſs, and that ſhe can not ſo much as lay by, much leſs keep what belongs to the Houſe. He complains, ſhe is a Gadder, a Goſſip, and Rambler, and that if once ſhe gets out of Doors, ſhe never returns till the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:108575:129"/>
Stars appear. On the other ſide, the poor Women wanting power to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, make uſe of their Tongues to complain. The Woman complains, that her Husband is Dull, Sullen, and Melancholy, and ſo ill Natur'd, the Neighbours can't abide, nor the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants endure him. She complains, he is Paſſionate, Proud and Impatient, and that many times in his Fury, he beats the Servants, and ſometimes unrigs her. She complains, he upbraids her of being ugly, naſty, and ill-bred, and that ſometimes he caſts ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches on her, her Heart is ready to burſt, and ſhe cries her Eyes out. She complains, he will not allow her to go ſee her Parents, and viſit her Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that meerly through Jealouſy, he will not let her go out of doors, and ſends her to Church, when it is half done. She complains, he is Miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and Jealous without ſenſe or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and therefore will not allow her to come near the Door, nor look out at the VVindow, nor wear her Cloaths, nor dreſs her Head, nor ſpeak a word to any body, but that ſhe muſt be watched like a Maid, and ſhut up like a Nun. She complains, he believes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:108575:130"/>
ſhe ſays, nor is pleaſed with any thing ſhe does; for when he is angry, he contradicts every body, and throws about whatſoever is next at hand. She complains, there is no Married VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man but he Courts, no VVidow but he follows, no ſingle VVoman but he Gallants, and no young VVench but he makes much of; and that he only keeps her (unhappy VVoman as ſhe is) to nurſe his Children, provide his Meat, and look to his Houſe. She complains, he is not ſatisfied to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Corn, Bacon, Butter, Oil and Cheeſe, out of the Houſe to give to his Miſtreſſes, but ſteals what ſhe works, to preſent them. She complains, he is a common Bubble and Gameſter, and that not ſatisfied to play away his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and all he gets, he loſes the Mova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Houſe, and her Jewels. She complains, he often comes home in ſuch a Rage, ſo furious and poſſeſt by the Devil, that no body is able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure him; for he whips the Children, ſcolds with the Maids, beats the Men, and ſometimes combs her Head. Theſe, and the like Complaints the Man makes of his VVife, and the VVoman of her Husband; and I think it is a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:108575:130"/>
in the Man, and VVeakneſs in the VVoman, to reveal ſuch things to thoſe who cannot remedy, and ought not to know them: I ſay, it is VVeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Indiſcretion; for they will not ſhew any body what is in their Trunks, and yet diſcover that which lyes in their Hearts. It is no harm for one Friend to ſhew another, his Stock or his Treaſure; but it is very inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to diſcloſe what we love, what we eſteem, and what we doat on, which ought not only to be kept, but hid and concealed. The Love or Hatred that lye in the Heart, ought not only to be ſhut, but ſealed up. VVhat more can I do for the Perſon I love, if I diſcover the Secrets of my Heart to every body? To him alone who heartily loves us, and whom we heartily love, muſt we diſcloſe what lyes in the Heart. Our Sufferings and Misfortunes ought not to be made known, but to thoſe that will help us to redreſs them, and will bear a part in lamenting them with us; for the compaſſionate Sorrow of a Friend, eaſes an afflicted Heart. If this be true, as really it is, to what end does a Man complain of his VVife, and the VVife of the Husband, to them they
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:108575:131"/>
know cannot help, but will rather ſcoff and jeer at them? If the Husband com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits an Extravagancy, or the VVife is guilty of ſome Failing, it is a ſign of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Senſe, and much Madneſs, to tell it to them that knew nothing of it; for it is leſs harm they ſhould ſurmiſe it, than know it from their own Mouths.</p>

               <p>It is alſo wholſom Advice, That Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands be very careful in providing for their Houſes, in cloathing their VVives, breeding their Children, and paying their Servants; for in things that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, they may be negligent, but muſt never be heedleſs or forgetful of what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. It is the Duty of a Husband to get, and the Wives to lay up and ſave. It is the Duty of the Husband, to go abroad and get his Living, and the Wives, to look to the Houſe. It is the Husbands Duty to provide Money, and the Wives to lay it out provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially. It is the Husbands Duty to deal with all Men, and the Wives to talk to few. It is the Husbands Duty to be prying, and the Wives to be cloſe. It is the Husbands Duty to talk well, and the Wives to be proud of ſaying little. It is the Husbands Duty to be zealous for his Honour, and the Wives to be very vertuous. It is the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:108575:131"/>
Duty to be very liberal, and the Wives to be ſaving. It is the Husbands Duty to wear ſuch Cloaths as he can afford, and the Wives to be dreſſed as ſhe ought to be. It is the Husbands Duty to be abſolute as Maſter of all, and the Wives to give an account of all. It is the Husbands Duty to manage all things without-doors, and the Wives to take care of all within. In fine, I ſay, it is the Husbands Duty to furniſh Money, and the Wives to govern the Family. That Houſe in which each does his Duty, may be called a well-governed Monaſtery; and that where every one draws a different way, is a meer Hell. A Wife ought not to deſire of her Husband any thing that is ſuperfluous and coſtly, nor if ſhe does, ought he to grant; but if ſhe asks only what is neceſſary, he is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not to deny: for a Man muſt engage even his Honour and Reputation, to furniſh his Wife, himſelf and Family. The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band who does not give his Wife a Petticoat, nor a Gown, nor Shoes, nor Linnen, nor a Scarf, nor Cloth wherewith to cloath the Children, or pay the Servants, and yet fees ſhe wants for nothing, but is plentifully ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; ſuch a Man has more cauſe to believe, ſhe got it by Rambling, than Sewing. How many Women are debauched, not thro' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, but becauſe their Husbands do not ſupply them with Neceſſaries, and ſo they redeem their Wants at the expence of their Honour. It is not enough to maintain a Houſe, that a Woman works, toils, and breaks her Reſt, unleſs the Husband takes
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:108575:132"/>
pains, is vigilant, and labours; otherwiſe the Houſe will be ſupplied at the charge of his Honour, and her Perſon. No Poverty or Want can excuſe a Woman, for doing any thing that may be to her Shame, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit of her Family; yet very often the Negligence of the Husband, makes a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man behave her ſelf ſaucily towards him, and impudently among others. I know not with what face a Man can check his Wife, if he never opens his Purſe to provide for her. The Husband who according to his Quality, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Family, may with Juſtice and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, chide his Wife for her careleſneſs, and check her Extravagancies; otherwiſe he muſt bear with whatſoever ſhe ſays, not take notice of what he hears, conceal what he ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and wink at what he ſees.</p>

impudent, the Husband is the firſt that ought to know, and remedy it; if he knows and ſuffers it, ſuch a ſenſeleſs Blockhead ought to be left to himſelf, ſince he will bear with it. One of the greateſt Sins we can commit, is to ſow Diſcord between Man and Wife; for if we diſcover any Neglect in him, or Weakneſs in her, we are obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, but may not accuſe them. Husbands are often to blame, for that they eaſily give credit to their Friends, Neighbours, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who generally, when they ſpeak ill of a Woman, are moved rather by Malice or Intereſt, than true Zeal. It is dangerous for the Husband to be familiar with ill Men, in reſpect of the Scandal that may accrue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; for ſome are ſo ſly and wicked, that they endeavour to become familiar with the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, only to gain acceſs to his Wife. It is but reaſonable, that Friends, Relations, Neighbours and Acquaintance of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, have a friendly acceſs to his Wife, but not that they be familiar; for Friendſhip will be preſerved at a diſtance, but Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity occaſions Deſigns. I would adviſe no Man to repoſe ſo much confidence in another, that he might truly ſay, I have the liberty of ſuch a Man's Houſe, I eat, jeſt, talk, play, and paſs away the time with his Wife; for the Lady has a particular Reſpect for me. I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor that Friend, who cannot paſs his time, but with the Wife of his Friend. All that may be ſaid in this caſe, is, Such a Man is my Friend, and I am acquainted with his Wife. It is an old Saying, That a Man may ſhew his
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:108575:133"/>
Wife and his Sword, but not truſt any body with them. If any Diſgrace happen the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, by carrying a Friend to his Houſe, and bringing him acquainted with his Wife, he may thank himſelf for carrying of him, but not complain of her for falling. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, It was eſtabliſhed by Law among the <hi>Parthians,</hi> that Wives ſhould have no other Acquaintance, but ſuch as were their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Friends: ſo that among thoſe <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> not only the Eſtate was in common between Married People, but even the choice of Friends. In my opinion, the Wife ought to love her Husband's Friends, and he her Kindred; for, if he will preſerve Unity in his Houſe, he muſt be pleaſed with his Wife, and eſteem her Relations. A Husband muſt not be ſo ill-natur'd, and rude, as not to ſpeak to, and invite his Wives Kindred, when they come to his Houſe; becauſe it is a great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to her, and a ſign of ill Breeding in him. Sometimes Women pick Acquaintance, and contract Friendſhip, that might very well be ſpared, tho' it be not any way ſuſpitious; and yet they quarrel and fall out with their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands about it, which is neither commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor tolerable; for a vertuous Woman will not ſo far engage in Friendſhip with any one, as may diſcompoſe her with her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. No honeſt Woman may ſay, <hi>This Man is my Friend,</hi> but <hi>this Man is my Acquaintance:</hi> for, a Wife ought to make none her Enemy, and to have no Friend but her Husband. I do not approve of Women being too paſſionate, or zealous in their Friends behalf; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

               <head>That a Wife ought to underſtand all Things, which appertain to Houſe-keeping.</head>
               <p>It is alſo wholſom Advice, That Married Women ſhould underſtand all that belongs to the Government of a Houſe, as Baking, Brewing, Dreſſing of Meat, Cleaning the Houſe, Sewing, and the like; for theſe things are ſo abſolutely neceſſary, they can neither live without them themſelves, nor much leſs, ever hope to pleaſe their Husbands. <hi>Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Tranquillus</hi> ſays, That the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> cauſed the Princeſſes his Daughters, to learn all thoſe things wherewith a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may maintain her ſelf, or which are commendable in her, inſomuch that they Spun and Wove all that they wore. Let a Lady be never ſo Great, ſo Noble, or ſo Rich, a Needle becomes her as well as a Sword does a Gentleman, or the Surplice a Prieſt. When the <hi>Romans</hi> upon a Wager, ſent from their their Camp to <hi>Rome,</hi> to know what every Man's Wife was doing, the chaſt <hi>Lucretia</hi> was the moſt applauded and commended, only becauſe ſhe alone was found Weaving, and all the other Idle. If any one object, that among Perſons of Quality, it is an underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing, to ſpeak of theſe inconſiderable things; I anſwer, a vertuous Woman need not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of Sewing, or Looking to her Houſe, but of Prating, and being Idle: for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Lady does not conſiſt in ſitting ſtill, but in being well employed. If Women
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:108575:134"/>
would work at home, we ſhould not ſee ſo many debauched about the Streets; for there is no ſo mortal Enemy to Chaſtity, as Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. What does that Woman think, that is young, handſom, healthy, free, airy and idle? Her Employment is to think, how ſhe may caſt her ſelf away, in ſuch manner that ſhe may deceive the World, believing ſhe is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and ſhe at the ſame time, enjoy all the Pleaſure of a Looſe Life. What greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is there, than to ſee a Woman riſe in the Morning, look about her Houſe, ſet things in Order, call the Servants, and dreſs her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? What greater pleaſure, than to ſee her overlook the Waſhing, the Brewing, the Baking, the cleaning the Houſe, the dreſſing the Meat, and after Dinner, ſit down to her Work? There is no Husband ſo mad, but likes his Wife better upon the <hi>Saturday,</hi> when ſhe ſees her Houſe cleaned, than on <hi>Sunday,</hi> when ſhe is ſet out in print. I do not like thoſe Women, that can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but go to Bed at one of the Clock, riſe at Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, eat at Twelve, and talk till Night, and all they know farther, is, how to have a Bed made to Sleep in, and a Room ſet out to receive Viſits; ſo that they ſeem Born only to Eat, Sleep, Prate, and be Idle. If you walk all the Houſe about, except the Bed where they lye, and the Room where they converſe, you will loath, and be aſhamed of it; you will find it ſo flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternly and naſty; ſo that many Ladies, meerly for Grandeur, make their Houſe a Hog-flye. To be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Employed, is a great ſtep towards being Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and on the contrary, a Woman that is Idle, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtudying Miſchief. Ladies, believe me, and keep your Daughters always Employed: for I muſt tell you, if you do not know it, That idle Hours and vain Thoughts, are the Foundation of all Miſchief. No more, but I pray God to keep you.</p>
